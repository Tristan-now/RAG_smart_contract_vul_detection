This code defines an external function named `claim`, which allows a user to claim their pending token rewards. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_tigAsset`: The address of the token that the user wants to claim as a reward.

Return Value:
This function does not return any value.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameter `_tigAsset`, which is the address of the token that the user wants to claim. Inside the function, the address of the message sender (`_msgsender`) is obtained using the `_msgSender()` function, which is a context-aware function provided by OpenZeppelin to get the actual sender of the transaction.
The function then calculates the amount of pending tokens that the user can claim by calling the `pending` function with the `_msgsender` address and the `_tigAsset` address as parameters. The calculated amount is stored in the `amount` variable.
The function then increments the amount of tokens that the user has already claimed for the specific `_tigAsset` by adding the `amount` to the `userPaid[_msgsender][_tigAsset]` mapping.
Finally, the function transfers the calculated `amount` of tokens from the `_tigAsset` token contract to the `_msgsender` address using the `transfer` function of the ERC20 token interface (`IERC20`).

Summary:
The `claim` function allows a user to claim their pending token rewards by calculating the amount, updating the user's claimed balance, and transferring the tokens to the user's address.
