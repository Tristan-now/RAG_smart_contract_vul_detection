This code snippet defines a function named `addMinter` that allows a governor to add a new minter address to the contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account`: The address of the account that will be added as a minter.

Modifiers:
- `onlyGovernor`: This modifier restricts the access to the function to only the governor of the contract. This means that only the governor can add a new minter.

Code Breakdown:
The function `addMinter` is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. However, it has the `onlyGovernor` modifier, which ensures that only the governor can execute this function. When the function is called with an `account` address as a parameter, it internally calls the `_addMinter` function, passing the `account` address to it. The `_addMinter` function is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract and is responsible for adding the provided account as a minter.

Summary:
The `addMinter` function provides a way for the governor to add new minters to the contract. It enforces the restriction that only the governor can perform this action by using the `onlyGovernor` modifier. This function helps in managing the minting capabilities of the contract by allowing the addition of new minters in a controlled manner.
