This code defines a public function named `cancelTransaction` that allows the admin to cancel a previously queued transaction in a timelock contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `target`: The address of the target contract or account for the transaction.
2. `value`: The amount of ether to be sent with the transaction.
3. `signature`: A string representing the function signature of the transaction.
4. `data`: The data payload for the transaction.
5. `eta`: The execution timestamp of the transaction.

Return Value:
This function does not return any value.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `target`, `value`, `signature`, `data`, and `eta`. The function can only be called by the admin address specified in the contract, as indicated by the `require` statement that checks if `msg.sender` is equal to `admin`. If the caller is not the admin, the function will revert with an error message.

Inside the function, a unique transaction hash (`txHash`) is generated by hashing the concatenation of `target`, `value`, `signature`, `data`, and `eta` using the `keccak256` function. This hash uniquely identifies the transaction that is being canceled.

The `queuedTransactions` mapping is then updated by setting the value corresponding to the `txHash` key to `false`, indicating that the transaction is no longer queued for execution.

Finally, an `CancelTransaction` event is emitted, providing information about the canceled transaction including the `txHash`, `target`, `value`, `signature`, `data`, and `eta`.

Summary:
The `cancelTransaction` function allows the admin to cancel a specific transaction by providing the necessary parameters and verifying the admin's identity. It updates the status of the transaction in the `queuedTransactions` mapping and emits an event to notify interested parties about the cancellation.
