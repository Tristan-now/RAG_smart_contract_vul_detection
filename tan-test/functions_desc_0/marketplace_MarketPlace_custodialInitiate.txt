This code defines an external function named `custodialInitiate`, which is only accessible by a specific address `swivel`. The function is responsible for initiating a custodial transaction by minting a specified amount of a ZcToken to a given address, adding the notional value to a VaultTracker, and emitting an event to log the transaction details. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `u`: An address representing the user initiating the custodial transaction.
2. `m`: A uint256 value representing the market identifier.
3. `z`: An address where the minted ZcToken will be sent.
4. `n`: An address representing the notional value to be added to the VaultTracker.
5. `a`: A uint256 value representing the amount of ZcToken to be minted and added as notional.

Return Value:
The function returns a boolean value indicating the success of the custodial initiation process.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `u`, `m`, `z`, `n`, and `a`. The function is restricted by the `onlySwivel` modifier, ensuring that only the designated `swivel` address can call this function. Within the function, two `require` statements are used to validate the success of two operations:
1. `ZcToken(markets[u][m].zcTokenAddr).mint(z, a)`: This line calls the `mint` function of the ZcToken contract associated with the specified market `m` and user `u`, minting `a` amount of ZcToken to the address `z`. If the minting operation fails, the function reverts with the error message 'mint failed'.
2. `VaultTracker(markets[u][m].vaultAddr).addNotional(n, a)`: This line calls the `addNotional` function of the VaultTracker contract associated with the specified market `m` and user `u`, adding `a` as notional value to the address `n`. If the addition of notional value fails, the function reverts with the error message 'add notional failed'.
After the successful execution of the minting and notional addition operations, an `emit` statement is used to log an event `CustodialInitiate` with the parameters `u`, `m`, `z`, `n`, and `a`. Finally, the function returns `true` to indicate the successful initiation of the custodial transaction.

Summary:
The `custodialInitiate` function allows the designated `swivel` address to initiate a custodial transaction by minting a specified amount of ZcToken to a given address and adding the notional value to a VaultTracker. The function ensures the success of these operations and emits an event to record the transaction details.
