This code defines an internal view function named `_msgSender`, which returns the address of the message sender as an address payable. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
This function does not take any parameters.

Return Value:
The function returns an `address payable` value representing the address of the message sender.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `internal` and `view` modifiers. The `internal` modifier restricts the function to be called only within the contract or its derived contracts, while the `view` modifier indicates that the function does not modify the state of the contract.
Inside the function body, `msg.sender` is used to retrieve the address of the account that sent the current transaction. This address is then implicitly converted to an `address payable` type using the `payable` keyword, ensuring that the address can receive Ether.
The function simply returns the address of the message sender as an `address payable` value.

Summary:
The `_msgSender` function provides a convenient way to access the address of the message sender within a smart contract. It is an internal view function that returns the address of the account that initiated the current transaction as an `address payable`.
