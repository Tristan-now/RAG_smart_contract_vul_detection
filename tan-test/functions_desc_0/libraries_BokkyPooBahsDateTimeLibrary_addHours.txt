This code defines an internal function named `addHours`, which calculates a new timestamp by adding a specified number of hours to a given timestamp. The function accepts two parameters: an initial timestamp (`timestamp`) and the number of hours to add (`_hours`). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `timestamp`: An unsigned integer representing the initial timestamp.
2. `_hours`: An unsigned integer representing the number of hours to add to the initial timestamp.

Return Value:
`newTimestamp`: The function returns a new unsigned integer value representing the updated timestamp after adding the specified number of hours.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `timestamp` and `_hours`. `addHours` is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts two parameters: `timestamp` (the initial timestamp) and `_hours` (the number of hours to add). The function returns a `uint` variable named `newTimestamp`, which will store the updated timestamp after adding the specified number of hours. Within the function, the new timestamp is calculated by adding `_hours` multiplied by the constant `SECONDS_PER_HOUR` to the initial timestamp. This calculation converts the number of hours to seconds. The function then includes a `require` statement to ensure that the new timestamp is greater than or equal to the initial timestamp. This check is important to prevent overflow or underflow issues. If the condition is not met, the function will revert. Finally, the function returns the updated timestamp `newTimestamp`.

Summary:
The `addHours` function takes an initial timestamp and a number of hours as input, calculates the new timestamp by converting hours to seconds and adding them to the initial timestamp, and ensures that the new timestamp is valid before returning it. This function provides a convenient way to add hours to a timestamp in Solidity smart contracts.
