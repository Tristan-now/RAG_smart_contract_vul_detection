This code snippet defines an external function named `setTreasuryAddress` that allows the contract owner to set the treasury address. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_treasury`: This is the address parameter that represents the new treasury address that the owner wants to set.

Function Modifier:
- `onlyOwner`: This modifier ensures that only the owner of the contract can call this function. It restricts access to authorized users.

Functionality:
- The function `setTreasuryAddress` is marked as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- The function takes one parameter `_treasury`, which is the new treasury address that the owner wants to set.
- The function is defined to override a function from an interface or a base contract, indicating that it implements a specific function signature.
- Inside the function, the treasury address variable `treasury` is updated with the new address `_treasury` provided by the owner.
- The `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that only the owner of the contract can successfully execute this function. This adds a layer of security by restricting access to authorized users.

Summary:
In summary, the `setTreasuryAddress` function allows the contract owner to update the treasury address. By providing a new address as a parameter, the owner can set the treasury address to the desired value. The function is externally accessible and restricted to the contract owner only, ensuring secure management of the treasury address.
