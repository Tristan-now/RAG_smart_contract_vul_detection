This code defines an external view function named `allowance` that retrieves the allowance granted by an `account` to a `spender`. The function accepts two parameters: `account` and `spender`, both of type `address`. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account`: The address of the account for which the allowance is being checked.
2. `spender`: The address of the spender for whom the allowance is being checked.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the allowance that `account` has granted to `spender`.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `account` and `spender`. `allowance` is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the contract state. The function accesses the `allowances` mapping using `account` as the first key and `spender` as the second key to retrieve the allowance value. This value is then returned as the result of the function.

Summary:
The `allowance` function provides a way to query the allowance granted by an `account` to a `spender` without modifying the contract state. It simply retrieves and returns the allowance value stored in the `allowances` mapping for the specified `account` and `spender` addresses.
