This code snippet defines a public view function named `par` that overrides a function from an interface and returns an `IERC20` interface instance.

Explanation:

1. Function Signature:
   - The function `par` is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract's state.
   - The function overrides a function from an interface, indicating that this contract implements an interface that defines a function with the same signature.
   - The function returns an `IERC20` interface instance.

2. Return Value:
   - The function returns an `IERC20` interface instance, which represents a token contract that complies with the ERC-20 token standard.

3. Code Breakdown:
   - Inside the function body, there is a single line of code that returns the `_par` variable.
   - The `_par` variable is assumed to be declared somewhere in the contract and holds an instance of an ERC-20 token contract that implements the `IERC20` interface.
   - By calling this function, external callers can retrieve the `_par` token contract instance, which can be used to interact with the token's functionalities defined in the ERC-20 standard.

4. Summary:
   - The `par` function provides external visibility to access the `_par` token contract instance, which is assumed to be an ERC-20 token complying with the `IERC20` interface. External callers can use this function to interact with the token contract and perform operations defined in the ERC-20 standard.
