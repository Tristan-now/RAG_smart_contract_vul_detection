This code defines an external function named `position` that retrieves and returns the `Position` struct associated with a specific `account` address. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account`: The address parameter represents the account for which the `Position` struct needs to be retrieved.

Return Value:
The function returns a `Position` struct that contains information about the position associated with the provided `account` address.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `external` visibility specifier, indicating that this function can be called from outside the contract. The function accepts a single parameter `account`, which is an address representing the account for which the position needs to be retrieved.
Within the function body, it accesses the `_positions` mapping using the provided `account` address as the key. The `_positions` mapping is assumed to store positions associated with different accounts.
The function retrieves the `Position` struct stored in the `_positions` mapping for the provided `account` address and returns it.
The `memory` keyword indicates that the `Position` struct is copied to memory before being returned to the caller. This is necessary because structs are complex data types and need to be explicitly handled in memory operations.
Summary:
The `position` function allows external callers to retrieve the `Position` struct associated with a specific account address. By providing an account address as a parameter, the function accesses the corresponding `Position` struct from the `_positions` mapping and returns it to the caller.
