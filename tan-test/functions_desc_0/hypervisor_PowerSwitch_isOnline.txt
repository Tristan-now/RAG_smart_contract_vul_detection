This code defines an external view function named `isOnline` that checks the status of a smart contract and returns a boolean value indicating whether the contract is online or not. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- `status`: The function returns a boolean value (`bool`) representing the online status of the contract. If the contract is in the `Online` state, it returns `true`, otherwise `false`.

Code Breakdown:
- The function signature includes the `external` and `view` modifiers, indicating that this function can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the contract state.
- The function body simply returns the comparison result of `_status` with `State.Online`. `_status` is assumed to be a state variable that holds the current state of the contract, and `State.Online` is a specific state value that represents the online state.
- If the `_status` variable is equal to `State.Online`, the function returns `true`, indicating that the contract is online. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Summary:
- The `isOnline` function provides a read-only view of the contract's online status by checking the value of the `_status` variable against the `State.Online` state. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the contract is online or not.
