This code defines an external function named `setAccountDepositCap` that allows the owner of the contract to set a new value for the account deposit cap. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_newAccountDepositCap`: A `uint256` value representing the new account deposit cap that the owner wants to set.

Function Modifier:
- `onlyOwner`: This modifier restricts the execution of the function to only the owner of the contract.

Return Value:
This function does not return any value.

Code Breakdown:
The function `setAccountDepositCap` is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. It overrides a function from an interface or a base contract. The function accepts one parameter `_newAccountDepositCap`, which is the new value for the account deposit cap that the owner wants to set. The function is restricted to be called only by the owner of the contract using the `onlyOwner` modifier. Inside the function, the `_accountDepositCap` state variable is updated with the new value `_newAccountDepositCap`. An event `AccountDepositCapChanged` is emitted to log the change in the account deposit cap with the new value `_newAccountDepositCap`.

Summary:
The `setAccountDepositCap` function allows the owner of the contract to update the account deposit cap to a new value. The function emits an event to log this change for transparency and tracking purposes.
