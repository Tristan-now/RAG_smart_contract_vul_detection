This code snippet defines an external function named `setOpenLev` that is part of a contract and is used to set the address of a variable named `openLev`. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_openlev`: This is the address parameter that is passed to the function. It represents the new address that will be assigned to the `openLev` variable.

Functionality:
- The function `setOpenLev` is marked as `external`, which means it can be called from outside the contract.
- The function has a modifier `onlyAdmin`, which implies that only an admin or a specific authorized entity can call this function.
- Inside the function, there is a `require` statement that checks if the `_openlev` address is not equal to `address(0)`. If the condition is not met, it will revert the transaction with the error message `'0x'`.
- If the `_openlev` address is valid (not equal to `address(0)`), the function assigns the `_openlev` address to the `openLev` variable.

Summary:
The `setOpenLev` function allows an admin or an authorized entity to set the address of the `openLev` variable to a new value. It performs a check to ensure that the new address is not `address(0)` before updating the variable. This function provides a way to update a specific address within the contract, potentially changing the behavior or functionality associated with that address.
