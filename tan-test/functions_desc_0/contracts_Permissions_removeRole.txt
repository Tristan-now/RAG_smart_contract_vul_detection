This code defines an external function named `removeRole` that allows the timelock role to revoke roles from entities. The function takes two parameters: a bytes32 role and an address _entity. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `role`: A bytes32 variable representing the role that the timelock wants to revoke from the entity.
2. `_entity`: An address representing the entity from which the timelock wants to revoke the role.

Function Modifier:
The function is restricted by the `onlyRole` modifier, which ensures that only the timelock role can call this function. If a caller other than the timelock role attempts to revoke roles, an error message "Only timelock can revoke roles" will be displayed.

Code Execution:
When the `removeRole` function is called, it first checks if the caller has the `TIMELOCK_ROLE` using the `onlyRole` modifier. If the caller is not the timelock role, the function will revert with the error message.

If the caller is the timelock role, the function proceeds to call the `revokeRole` function, passing the `role` and `_entity` as parameters. The `revokeRole` function is responsible for revoking the specified role from the given entity.

Summary:
The `removeRole` function provides a way for the timelock role to revoke roles from entities by calling the `revokeRole` function internally. The function ensures that only the timelock role has the authority to revoke roles, adding an extra layer of security to role management within the smart contract.
