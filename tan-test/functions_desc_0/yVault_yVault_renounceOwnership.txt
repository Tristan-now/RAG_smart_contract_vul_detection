This code snippet defines a function named `renounceOwnership` that is a public view function and overrides a function from a parent contract with the `onlyOwner` modifier. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

- Visibility and Modifier:
  - `public`: This function can be called from outside the contract.
  - `view`: This function does not modify the state of the contract.
  - `override`: This function overrides a function from a parent contract.
  - `onlyOwner`: This is a custom modifier that restricts access to the function to only the owner of the contract.

- Functionality:
  - The `renounceOwnership` function is designed to prevent the current owner of the contract from renouncing their ownership. 
  - When this function is called, it immediately reverts the transaction with the error message "Cannot renounce ownership".
  - This means that the contract owner is not allowed to renounce their ownership rights, ensuring that the ownership remains with the designated owner.

- Summary:
  - The `renounceOwnership` function serves as a security measure to prevent the current owner from renouncing their ownership rights, thereby maintaining control of the contract within the designated owner.
