This code defines a public view function named `getExternalPositionRealUnit` that retrieves the real unit value of an external position for a given component and position module. The function takes two parameters: `_component`, which is the address of the component token, and `_positionModule`, which is the address of the position module.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_component`: The address of the component token for which the real unit value of the external position needs to be retrieved.
2. `_positionModule`: The address of the position module that holds the external position.

Return Value:
The function returns an `int256` value representing the real unit value of the external position for the given component and position module.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `_component` and `_positionModule`. `getExternalPositionRealUnit` is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract.
Within the function, the `_externalPositionVirtualUnit` function is called with `_component` and `_positionModule` as parameters. This function retrieves the virtual unit value of the external position for the given component and position module.
The `_convertVirtualToRealUnit` function is then called with the virtual unit value obtained from `_externalPositionVirtualUnit` as a parameter. This function converts the virtual unit value to a real unit value and returns it.
The real unit value of the external position for the given component and position module is ultimately returned by the `getExternalPositionRealUnit` function.

Summary:
The `getExternalPositionRealUnit` function retrieves the real unit value of an external position for a specific component and position module by first obtaining the virtual unit value of the external position and then converting it to a real unit value.
