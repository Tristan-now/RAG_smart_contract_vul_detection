This code defines an internal pure function named `readUint16`, which reads a `uint16` value from a specified index in a given `bytes` memory array. The function accepts two parameters: the `bytes` memory array (`self`) and the index (`idx`) from which to read the `uint16` value. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `self`: A `bytes` memory array that contains the data from which to read the `uint16` value.
2. `idx`: An unsigned integer representing the index from which to read the `uint16` value.

Return Value:
`ret`: The function returns a `uint16` value that is read from the specified index in the `bytes` memory array.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `self` and `idx`. `readUint16` is an internal pure function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts, and it does not modify the contract's state.
The function starts with a `require` statement to ensure that the specified index (`idx`) plus 2 does not exceed the length of the `self` array. This check prevents reading beyond the bounds of the array.
Inside the assembly block, the function uses low-level inline assembly to read a `uint16` value from the specified index in the `self` array. The `mload` function is used to load a 32-byte word from the specified memory location, and the `and` operation is applied to mask out all but the least significant 16 bits (0xFFFF) of the loaded word.
The resulting masked value is then assigned to the `ret` variable, which holds the `uint16` value read from the specified index in the `self` array.
Summary:
The `readUint16` function reads a `uint16` value from a specified index in a given `bytes` memory array using inline assembly. It performs a bounds check to ensure that the read operation does not exceed the array length and returns the extracted `uint16` value.
