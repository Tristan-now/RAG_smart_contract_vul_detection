This code defines a public view function named `totalUsefulCollateral` that calculates the total amount of useful collateral held by different contracts. The function retrieves the balances of the collateral token held by four different contracts: `auctionPool`, `rewardOverflow`, `liquidityExtension`, and `swingTrader`. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- `collateral`: The function returns a `uint256` value representing the total amount of useful collateral held by the specified contracts.

Code Breakdown:
The function `totalUsefulCollateral` is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract state. Inside the function, the balances of the collateral token held by four different contracts are retrieved using the `balanceOf` function of the `collateralToken` contract. The balances are stored in variables `auctionPoolBalance`, `overflowBalance`, `liquidityExtensionBalance`, and `swingTraderBalance`, respectively. These variables represent the amount of collateral held by the `auctionPool`, `rewardOverflow`, `liquidityExtension`, and `swingTrader` contracts. Finally, the function calculates the total amount of useful collateral by summing up the balances of all four contracts and returns this total value.

Summary:
The `totalUsefulCollateral` function calculates the total amount of useful collateral held by the `auctionPool`, `rewardOverflow`, `liquidityExtension`, and `swingTrader` contracts by retrieving the balances of the collateral token held by each contract and summing them up. The function then returns the total amount of useful collateral.
