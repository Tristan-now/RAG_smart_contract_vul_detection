This code snippet defines a public view function named `userInfo` that overrides a function from an interface. The function takes an address `_user` as a parameter and returns a `UserInfo` struct.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_user`: An address representing the user for whom the information is being retrieved.

Return Value:
`UserInfo memory`: The function returns a `UserInfo` struct containing information about the specified user.

Code Breakdown:
The `userInfo` function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract state. The function overrides a function from an interface, indicating that the contract implementing this function must adhere to the interface's specifications.

Within the function, `_users[_user]` is accessed, where `_users` is likely a mapping that stores user information. By passing the `_user` address as the key, the function retrieves the `UserInfo` struct associated with that user.

The function then returns this `UserInfo` struct as a memory variable, indicating that the struct is temporary and does not persist beyond the function execution.

Summary:
The `userInfo` function allows external callers to retrieve information about a specific user by providing the user's address as a parameter. It fetches the user's information from a mapping and returns it as a `UserInfo` struct.
