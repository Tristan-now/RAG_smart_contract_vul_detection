This code defines an internal view function named `_getPastDelegate`, which is used to retrieve the delegate address associated with a specific account at a past block number. The function takes two parameters: `account`, which is the address of the account for which the delegate address is being retrieved, and `blockNumber`, which is the block number at which the delegate address is being queried.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account`: The address of the account for which the delegate address is being retrieved.
2. `blockNumber`: The block number at which the delegate address is being queried.

Return Value:
The function returns an `address` value representing the delegate address associated with the account at the specified block number.

Code Breakdown:
The function starts with a `require` statement to ensure that the `blockNumber` provided is less than the current block number. This check is necessary to prevent querying delegate information from future blocks.

The function then checks if there are any delegate checkpoints recorded for the specified account. If there are no checkpoints, the function returns address(0) indicating that there is no delegate information available for the account.

Next, the function checks the last recorded checkpoint to see if it is older than or equal to the specified `blockNumber`. If it is, the delegate address from that checkpoint is returned.

If the last checkpoint is not old enough, the function performs a binary search on the delegate checkpoints to find the delegate address associated with the account at the specified `blockNumber`. The binary search algorithm divides the search range in half at each step, narrowing down the range until the exact checkpoint for the specified `blockNumber` is found.

If the exact checkpoint is found, the delegate address from that checkpoint is returned. If the checkpoint is not found, the function returns the delegate address from the checkpoint just before the specified `blockNumber`.

Summary:
The `_getPastDelegate` function retrieves the delegate address associated with a specific account at a past block number by searching through the delegate checkpoints recorded for that account. It uses a binary search algorithm to efficiently locate the delegate address corresponding to the specified `blockNumber`.
