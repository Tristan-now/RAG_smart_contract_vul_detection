This code snippet defines an internal function named `debit` that is responsible for subtracting a specified `UFixed18` amount from the `total` value stored in an `OptimisticLedger` struct. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `self`: An `OptimisticLedger` struct that contains the ledger information, including the `total` value that needs to be updated.
2. `amount`: A `UFixed18` value representing the amount to be subtracted from the `total` value.

Code Breakdown:
The `debit` function takes two parameters: `self` of type `OptimisticLedger` and `amount` of type `UFixed18`. It is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. Within the function, the `total` value stored in the `OptimisticLedger` struct is updated by subtracting the `amount` value using the `sub` function. The `sub` function is likely a safe subtraction function that ensures no underflow occurs during the operation. The result of the subtraction is then assigned back to the `total` value in the `OptimisticLedger` struct, effectively reducing the total value by the specified amount.

Summary:
The `debit` function is used to deduct a specified `UFixed18` amount from the `total` value stored in an `OptimisticLedger` struct. It ensures that the subtraction operation is performed safely to prevent underflow issues. This function is internal, meaning it can only be accessed within the contract or its derived contracts.
