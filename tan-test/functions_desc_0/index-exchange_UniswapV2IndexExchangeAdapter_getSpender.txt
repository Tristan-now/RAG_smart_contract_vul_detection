This code defines an external function named `getSpender` that is part of a contract that overrides a predefined interface. The function returns the address of a router.

Explanation:

- Function Signature:
  - `getSpender()`: This is an external function that does not modify the contract's state and is accessible from outside the contract.
  - `external`: This function can be called from outside the contract.
  - `view`: This function does not modify the contract's state.
  - `override`: This function overrides a function from an inherited interface.

- Return Value:
  - The function returns an `address` which represents the address of the router.

- Code Breakdown:
  - The function simply returns the value of the `router` variable without any additional logic.
  - The `router` variable is assumed to be a state variable defined elsewhere in the contract.
  - Since the function is marked as `view`, it does not modify the contract's state and only reads the value of the `router` variable.
  - The function is marked as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.

Summary:
The `getSpender` function is an external view function that returns the address of the router without performing any additional operations. It simply reads and returns the value of the `router` variable.
