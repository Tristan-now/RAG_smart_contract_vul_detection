This code defines an internal pure function named `changeTokenAllowed`, which checks if a specific bit in the metadata of a `JBFundingCycle` struct is set to 1. The function accepts a `JBFundingCycle` struct as a parameter and returns a boolean value indicating whether the bit is set or not. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_fundingCycle`: A `JBFundingCycle` struct that contains metadata used to determine if a specific bit is set.

Return Value:
The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the specific bit in the metadata is set to 1 (`true`) or not (`false`).

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameter `_fundingCycle`, which is a `JBFundingCycle` struct. The function is defined as `internal pure`, meaning it can only be called within the contract and does not read or modify state variables.
Within the function, a bitwise right shift operation is performed on the `metadata` field of the `_fundingCycle` struct by 77 bits. This operation effectively isolates the bit at position 77 in the metadata.
The result of this bitwise operation is then bitwise ANDed with 1. This bitwise AND operation checks if the isolated bit is set to 1. If the result is equal to 1, the function returns `true`, indicating that the specific bit is set. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
Summary:
The `changeTokenAllowed` function checks if a specific bit in the metadata of a `JBFundingCycle` struct is set to 1 and returns a boolean value based on the result of this check.
