This code defines an internal function named `_initializeMixinLockCore`, which is responsible for initializing the parameters of a mixin lock core contract. The function takes four parameters: `_beneficiary`, `_expirationDuration`, `_keyPrice`, and `_maxNumberOfKeys`. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_beneficiary`: An address payable representing the beneficiary of the lock.
2. `_expirationDuration`: A uint representing the duration of the lock expiration in seconds.
3. `_keyPrice`: A uint representing the price of a key for the lock.
4. `_maxNumberOfKeys`: A uint representing the maximum number of keys that can be purchased for the lock.

Code Breakdown:
The function `_initializeMixinLockCore` is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function first checks if the `_expirationDuration` is less than or equal to 100 years (in seconds) to ensure that the expiration duration is within a reasonable range. If the condition is not met, the function will revert with the error message 'MAX_EXPIRATION_100_YEARS'.

Next, the function assigns the address of the calling contract (Unlock's smart contract) to the `unlockProtocol` variable by casting `msg.sender` to the `IUnlock` interface. This step ensures that the mixin lock core is linked back to Unlock's smart contract.

The function then assigns the values of `_beneficiary`, `_expirationDuration`, `_keyPrice`, and `_maxNumberOfKeys` to the respective state variables `beneficiary`, `expirationDuration`, `keyPrice`, and `maxNumberOfKeys`.

Summary:
The `_initializeMixinLockCore` function initializes the parameters of a mixin lock core contract by setting the beneficiary, expiration duration, key price, and maximum number of keys based on the input parameters. It also ensures that the expiration duration is within a reasonable range and links the mixin lock core back to Unlock's smart contract.
