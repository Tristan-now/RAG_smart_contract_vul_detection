This code defines an external function named `setRecord` that overrides a virtual function from an inherited contract. The function is responsible for setting the owner, resolver, and time-to-live (TTL) values for a given node in the contract's state. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `node`: A bytes32 variable representing the node for which the record is being set.
2. `owner`: An address representing the new owner of the node.
3. `resolver`: An address representing the resolver for the node.
4. `ttl`: A uint64 value representing the time-to-live for the node.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `node`, `owner`, `resolver`, and `ttl`. The function is marked as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function overrides a virtual function defined in an inherited contract, indicating that it provides a specific implementation for this function.

Within the function body, two internal functions are called:
1. `setOwner(node, owner)`: This function sets the owner of the specified node to the provided `owner` address.
2. `_setResolverAndTTL(node, resolver, ttl)`: This function sets the resolver and time-to-live values for the specified node. The underscore prefix typically indicates that this function is meant to be used internally within the contract.

Summary:
The `setRecord` function is used to set the owner, resolver, and time-to-live values for a specific node in the contract's state. It delegates the tasks of setting the owner and resolver/TTL values to internal functions, providing a clean and modular approach to managing node records within the contract.
