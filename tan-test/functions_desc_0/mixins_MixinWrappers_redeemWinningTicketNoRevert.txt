This code defines an internal function named `redeemWinningTicketNoRevert` that is responsible for redeeming a winning ticket without reverting in case of failure. The function takes three parameters: a `Ticket` struct, a signature `_sig`, and a random number `_recipientRand`. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_ticket`: A `Ticket` struct that contains information about the ticket, including the ticket owner's address, ticket ID, ticket amount, ticket expiration, ticket hash, and additional data.
2. `_sig`: A signature that is used to validate the authenticity of the ticket.
3. `_recipientRand`: A random number used as part of the redemption process.

Return Value:
`success`: A boolean value that indicates whether the redemption process was successful or not.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `_ticket`, `_sig`, and `_recipientRand`. `redeemWinningTicketNoRevert` is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function first ABI encodes the calldata for the `redeemWinningTicket()` function. The `abi.encodeWithSignature` function is used to encode the function signature along with the parameters `_ticket`, `_sig`, and `_recipientRand`. The `redeemWinningTicketCalldata` variable stores the encoded calldata for the function call. Next, the function calls the `redeemWinningTicket()` function using the `address(this).call` method. This method executes the function call and returns a tuple containing the success status of the call. The `success` variable is assigned the success status of the function call.

Summary:
The `redeemWinningTicketNoRevert` function encodes the calldata for the `redeemWinningTicket()` function with the provided parameters and then calls the function using the encoded calldata. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the redemption process was successful or not, without reverting in case of failure.
