This code snippet defines a function named `balanceOf` that overrides the `balanceOf` function from the `BaseRewardPool` contract and the `IERC20` interface. The function takes an `address` parameter named `account` and returns a `uint256` value representing the balance of the specified account.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account`: An address parameter representing the account for which the balance needs to be retrieved.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the balance of the specified account.

Code Breakdown:
The `balanceOf` function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract. The function overrides the `balanceOf` function from the `BaseRewardPool` contract and the `IERC20` interface.

Within the function body, it simply calls the `balanceOf` function from the `BaseRewardPool` contract, passing the `account` parameter to retrieve the balance of the specified account. The return value from the `BaseRewardPool.balanceOf(account)` function call is then returned by the `balanceOf` function.

Summary:
The `balanceOf` function provides a way to retrieve the balance of a specific account by calling the `balanceOf` function from the `BaseRewardPool` contract. This function is used to query the balance of an account within the context of the smart contract.
