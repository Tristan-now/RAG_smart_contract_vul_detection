This code defines an external view function named `pendingPremium` that calculates the pending premium for a specific index. The function takes an address `_index` as a parameter and returns a `uint256` value representing the pending premium.

Parameters:
1. `_index`: An address parameter that represents the index for which the pending premium is being calculated.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the pending premium for the specified index.

Code Breakdown:
The function first retrieves the credit value associated with the given index `_index` from the `indicies` mapping and stores it in the `_credit` variable.
If the `_credit` value is equal to 0, the function immediately returns 0 as there is no pending premium to calculate.
If the `_credit` value is not 0, the function proceeds to calculate the pending premium.
The pending premium calculation involves subtracting the `rewardDebt` value associated with the index from the product of `_credit` multiplied by `rewardPerCredit` divided by `MAGIC_SCALE_1E6`.
The `_sub` function is used to perform the subtraction operation, ensuring that the result is a positive value.
The calculated result represents the pending premium for the specified index, which is then returned by the function.

Summary:
The `pendingPremium` function calculates the pending premium for a specific index by retrieving the credit and reward debt values associated with the index from the `indicies` mapping. It then performs a calculation to determine the pending premium amount and returns this value as a `uint256`.
