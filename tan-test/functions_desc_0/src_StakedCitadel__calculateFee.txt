This code defines an internal pure function named `_calculateFee`, which calculates the fee amount based on a given percentage of the total amount. The function accepts two parameters: `amount` (the total amount on which the fee is calculated) and `feeBps` (the fee percentage in basis points). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `amount`: A `uint256` value representing the total amount on which the fee is calculated.
2. `feeBps`: A `uint256` value representing the fee percentage in basis points (BPS).

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the calculated fee amount.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `amount` and `feeBps`. `_calculateFee` is an internal pure function, meaning it can only be called within the contract and does not read or modify state variables. The function calculates the fee amount based on the given percentage of the total amount. If the `feeBps` is equal to 0, indicating that there is no fee, the function immediately returns 0.
If there is a fee percentage specified, the function calculates the fee amount by multiplying the `amount` by the `feeBps` and then dividing the result by the constant `MAX_BPS`. The `MAX_BPS` is assumed to be a predefined constant representing the maximum value of basis points (e.g., 10,000 for 100%).
The calculated fee amount is stored in the `fee` variable and then returned as the result of the function.

Summary:
The `_calculateFee` function computes the fee amount based on a given percentage of the total amount using basis points. It handles cases where the fee percentage is 0 and calculates the fee amount accordingly, returning the final fee value.
