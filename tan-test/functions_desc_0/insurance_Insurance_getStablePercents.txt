This code defines a private view function named `getStablePercents` that returns an array of `uint256` values representing stable percents. The function iterates over a constant `N_COINS` (number of coins) and assigns the corresponding value from the `underlyingTokensPercents` array to the `stablePercents` array. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- `stablePercents`: An array of `uint256` values representing stable percents for each coin.

Code Breakdown:
- The function signature includes the `private` and `view` modifiers, indicating that it is a private function that can only be viewed and not modified.
- The function initializes an array `stablePercents` of type `uint256` with a length of `N_COINS` (number of coins).
- A `for` loop is used to iterate over the indices from 0 to `N_COINS - 1`.
- Within each iteration, the value at index `i` from the `underlyingTokensPercents` array is assigned to the corresponding index in the `stablePercents` array.
- Once all iterations are complete, the function returns the `stablePercents` array containing the stable percents for each coin.

Summary:
The `getStablePercents` function retrieves the stable percents for each coin by iterating over the `underlyingTokensPercents` array and storing the values in a new array `stablePercents`. This function provides a way to access the stable percents data in a structured format for further processing or analysis within the smart contract.
