This code snippet defines an internal function named `_msgSender`, which is used to retrieve the address of the message sender. The function overrides the `_msgSender` function from both the `Context` and `MetaContext` contracts. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- `sender`: The function returns an `address` value representing the address of the message sender.

Code Breakdown:
- The function signature includes the `internal` visibility specifier, indicating that the function can only be accessed within the contract or its derived contracts.
- The function is defined as `view`, meaning it does not modify the state of the contract.
- The function overrides the `_msgSender` function from both the `Context` and `MetaContext` contracts, ensuring that the most specific implementation of `_msgSender` is used.
- Within the function body, it simply calls the `_msgSender` function from the `MetaContext` contract using `MetaContext._msgSender()` and returns the result. This allows the function to retrieve the address of the message sender based on the context provided by `MetaContext`.

Summary:
The `_msgSender` function is a utility function that retrieves the address of the message sender by calling the `_msgSender` function from the `MetaContext` contract. This function is essential for identifying the entity that triggered a particular function call within the smart contract.
