This code defines an external function named `quantRolesLength`, which is part of a contract that overrides a function from an inherited interface. The function is responsible for returning the length of an array called `configuredQuantRoles`. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
None

Return Value:
`uint256`: The function returns a `uint256` value representing the length of the `configuredQuantRoles` array.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `external` visibility specifier, indicating that the function can be called from outside the contract, and the `view` modifier, indicating that the function does not modify the contract's state. The function also includes the `override` keyword, indicating that it overrides a function from an inherited interface. The function body simply contains a `return` statement that returns the length of the `configuredQuantRoles` array.

Summary:
The `quantRolesLength` function provides a read-only view of the length of the `configuredQuantRoles` array. It allows external callers to retrieve this information without modifying the contract's state.
