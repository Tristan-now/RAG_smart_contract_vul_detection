This code defines an internal pure function named `verifyCallResult`, which is used to handle the result of an external call in a smart contract. The function accepts three parameters: a boolean `success` indicating whether the call was successful, a `bytes` array `returndata` containing the return data from the external call, and a `string` `errorMessage` to be used in case of failure. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `success`: A boolean value that indicates whether the external call was successful.
2. `returndata`: A `bytes` array that stores the return data from the external call.
3. `errorMessage`: A string that contains the error message to be used if the call was not successful.

Return Value:
The function returns a `bytes` array, which contains the return data from the external call if it was successful. If the call was not successful, it either reverts with the revert reason from the external call or reverts with the provided `errorMessage`.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `success`, `returndata`, and `errorMessage`. `verifyCallResult` is an internal pure function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the contract's state. The function returns a `bytes` array, which contains the return data from the external call if it was successful.
The function first checks if the external call was successful by evaluating the `success` parameter. If the call was successful, it simply returns the `returndata`.
If the call was not successful, the function checks if the `returndata` array is not empty. If it is not empty, it uses assembly to extract the revert reason from the `returndata` and reverts with that reason.
If the `returndata` is empty, meaning there was no revert reason provided by the external call, the function reverts with the provided `errorMessage`.

Summary:
The `verifyCallResult` function is used to handle the result of an external call in a smart contract. It checks if the call was successful and returns the return data if it was. If the call was not successful, it extracts and bubbles up the revert reason or reverts with the provided error message.
