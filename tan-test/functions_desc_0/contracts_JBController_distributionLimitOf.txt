This code defines an external view function named `distributionLimitOf` that retrieves the distribution limit and currency information for a specific project, configuration, payment terminal, and token. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_projectId`: A uint256 value representing the project ID for which the distribution limit is being queried.
2. `_configuration`: A uint256 value representing the configuration ID for which the distribution limit is being queried.
3. `_terminal`: An address of type `IJBPaymentTerminal` representing the payment terminal for which the distribution limit is being queried.
4. `_token`: An address representing the token for which the distribution limit is being queried.

Return Values:
The function returns a tuple containing two uint256 values:
1. The distribution limit (in bits 0-231).
2. The currency information (in bits 232-255).

Code Breakdown:
1. The function signature includes the parameters `_projectId`, `_configuration`, `_terminal`, and `_token`. It is an external view function, meaning it can be called outside the contract and does not modify the state.
2. The function first retrieves the packed distribution limit data for the specified `_projectId`, `_configuration`, `_terminal`, and `_token` from the `_packedDistributionLimitDataOf` mapping and stores it in the variable `_data`.
3. The distribution limit is extracted from the lower 232 bits of `_data` by casting `_data` to a uint232 type.
4. The currency information is extracted from the upper 24 bits (bits 232-255) of `_data` by shifting `_data` to the right by 232 bits.
5. The function returns a tuple containing the distribution limit and currency information extracted in the previous steps.

Summary:
The `distributionLimitOf` function retrieves the distribution limit and currency information for a specific project, configuration, payment terminal, and token by unpacking the packed data stored in the `_packedDistributionLimitDataOf` mapping. It then returns this information as a tuple of uint256 values.
