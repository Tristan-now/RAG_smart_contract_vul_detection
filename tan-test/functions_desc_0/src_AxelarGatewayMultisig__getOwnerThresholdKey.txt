This code defines an internal pure function named `_getOwnerThresholdKey`, which generates a unique key based on the epoch value. The function accepts one parameter:

Parameter:
1. `epoch`: A uint256 value representing the epoch for which the key needs to be generated.

Return Value:
The function returns a `bytes32` value representing the unique key generated based on the epoch value.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameter `epoch`. `_getOwnerThresholdKey` is an internal pure function, meaning it can only be called within the contract and does not read or modify state variables. The function takes the `epoch` value and encodes it using `abi.encodePacked` along with the constant `PREFIX_OWNER_THRESHOLD`. The `abi.encodePacked` function concatenates the arguments without padding or length prefix. The `keccak256` function is then applied to the encoded value to generate a unique 32-byte hash key. This key is based on the combination of the constant prefix and the epoch value.

Summary:
The `_getOwnerThresholdKey` function generates a unique key based on the epoch value by encoding the epoch along with a constant prefix and hashing the result using `keccak256`. This key can be used to access or store specific data related to a particular epoch in the contract.
