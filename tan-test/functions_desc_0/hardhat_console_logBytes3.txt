This code defines an internal view function named `logBytes3` that takes a `bytes3` parameter `p0` and logs the payload using the `_sendLogPayload` function. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `p0`: A `bytes3` parameter representing the input value to be logged.

Code Breakdown:
The `logBytes3` function is defined as internal, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and is marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract.
Within the function, the `_sendLogPayload` function is called with the payload generated by `abi.encodeWithSignature("log(bytes3)", p0)`. This encodes the function signature "log(bytes3)" along with the parameter `p0` into a byte array, which is then passed to `_sendLogPayload` for logging.

Summary:
The `logBytes3` function in this code snippet is responsible for logging the `bytes3` input parameter `p0` by encoding it with the function signature and passing it to the `_sendLogPayload` function for logging.
