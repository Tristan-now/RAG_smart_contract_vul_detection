This code defines a private function `_mintFee` that calculates and mints the fee for providing liquidity in a Uniswap-like decentralized exchange. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_reserve0`: A uint112 representing the reserve of token 0 in the liquidity pool.
2. `_reserve1`: A uint112 representing the reserve of token 1 in the liquidity pool.

Return Value:
`feeOn`: A boolean value indicating whether a fee is enabled for the liquidity provision.

Code Breakdown:
The function `_mintFee` is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract it is defined in. It accepts two parameters `_reserve0` and `_reserve1`, which represent the reserves of the two tokens in the liquidity pool. The function returns a boolean variable `feeOn`, which indicates whether a fee is enabled for liquidity provision.

The function first retrieves the address to which the fee will be minted by calling the `feeTo` function on the UniswapV2Factory contract. It then checks if the feeTo address is not equal to 0, which determines whether a fee is enabled.

Next, the function retrieves the previous value of `k` (the product of reserves) from the `kLast` variable for gas savings. If a fee is enabled, the function proceeds to calculate the fee based on the change in the square root of the product of reserves.

If the previous `k` value is not 0, the function calculates the change in the square root of the product of reserves and determines the amount of liquidity to mint as a fee. This calculation involves the total supply of the liquidity token, the difference in square roots, and a denominator based on the square roots.

If the calculated liquidity amount is greater than 0, the function mints this liquidity to the `feeTo` address.

If a fee is not enabled and the previous `k` value is not 0, the function sets the `kLast` variable to 0, effectively resetting the previous `k` value.

Summary:
The `_mintFee` function calculates and mints the fee for providing liquidity in a Uniswap-like decentralized exchange. It checks if a fee is enabled, calculates the fee based on the change in reserves, and mints the fee as liquidity tokens to the specified address. If a fee is not enabled, it resets the previous `k` value.
