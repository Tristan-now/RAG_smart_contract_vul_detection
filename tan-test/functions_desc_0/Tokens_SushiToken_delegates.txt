This code snippet defines an external view function named `delegates` that takes an `address` parameter `delegator` and returns another `address`. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `delegator`: An address parameter representing the delegator for whom we want to retrieve the delegate address.

Return Value:
The function returns an `address` representing the delegate address associated with the provided `delegator`.

Code Breakdown:
The `delegates` function is defined as an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the contract state.
The function takes an `address` parameter named `delegator`, which is the address of the delegator for whom we want to retrieve the delegate address.
Inside the function, it simply returns the value stored in the `_delegates` mapping at the key `delegator`. This mapping is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract and stores the delegate address for each delegator.
When the function is called with a specific `delegator` address, it retrieves the corresponding delegate address from the `_delegates` mapping and returns it to the caller.
Overall, the `delegates` function provides a way to query and retrieve the delegate address associated with a given delegator address without modifying the contract state.
