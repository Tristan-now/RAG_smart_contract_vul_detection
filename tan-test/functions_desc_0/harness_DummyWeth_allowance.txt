This code defines an external view function named `allowance` that retrieves the allowance granted by an owner to a spender. The function accepts two parameters: `owner` and `spender`, both of type `address`. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `owner`: The address of the owner who granted the allowance.
2. `spender`: The address of the spender for whom the allowance is granted.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the allowance granted by the `owner` to the `spender`.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `owner` and `spender`. `allowance` is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the contract state. The function accesses the allowance data stored in a mapping named `a`. The mapping `a` is a two-dimensional mapping where the keys are addresses (`owner` and `spender`) and the values are `uint256` representing the allowance granted. By accessing `a[owner][spender]`, the function retrieves the allowance granted by the `owner` to the `spender`. This value is then returned as the result of the function.

Summary:
The `allowance` function allows external callers to query the allowance granted by an `owner` to a `spender`. It retrieves this information from the `a` mapping and returns the allowance as a `uint256` value.
