This code defines an external function named `totalSupply` that is part of a smart contract. The function is used to retrieve the total supply of a token. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- `uint256`: The function returns a `uint256` value representing the total supply of the token.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `external` visibility specifier, indicating that the function can be called from outside the contract. The `view` modifier indicates that the function does not modify the contract's state.
The function body simply returns the `_totalSupply` variable. This variable presumably stores the total supply of the token. By calling this function, external parties can query the total supply of the token without altering the contract's state.

Summary:
The `totalSupply` function provides a read-only view of the total supply of the token by returning the `_totalSupply` variable. This function is useful for external parties to retrieve essential information about the token's total supply without affecting the contract's state.
