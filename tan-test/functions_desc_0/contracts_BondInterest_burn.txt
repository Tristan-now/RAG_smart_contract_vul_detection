This code snippet defines an external function named `burn` that overrides a function from an interface and is restricted to be called only by a specific modifier `onlyConvenience`. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `from`: An address parameter representing the account from which the tokens will be burned.
2. `amount`: A `uint128` parameter representing the amount of tokens to be burned.

Functionality:
The `burn` function is designed to burn a specific amount of tokens from a given address. It calls the internal `_burn` function with the provided `from` address and `amount` of tokens to be burned.

Modifier:
The `onlyConvenience` modifier restricts the external access to this function. It ensures that only specific contracts or addresses with the appropriate permissions can call the `burn` function.

Summary:
The `burn` function allows for the burning of a specified amount of tokens from a given address, and it enforces the restriction that only authorized contracts or addresses can trigger this action through the `onlyConvenience` modifier.
