This code defines an external view function named `getRewardSnapshotYUSD`, which retrieves the YUSD debt snapshot for a specific borrower and token. The function accepts two parameters: the address of the borrower (`_borrower`) and the address of the token (`_token`). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_borrower`: The address of the borrower for whom the YUSD debt snapshot needs to be retrieved.
2. `_token`: The address of the token for which the YUSD debt snapshot is requested.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint` value representing the YUSD debt snapshot for the specified borrower and token.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `_borrower` and `_token`. `getRewardSnapshotYUSD` is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the contract state.
The function retrieves the YUSD debt snapshot for the specified borrower and token from the `rewardSnapshots` mapping. The mapping is structured as `rewardSnapshots[_borrower].YUSDDebts[_token]`, where `_borrower` is the key to access the borrower's snapshot and `YUSDDebts[_token]` retrieves the YUSD debt for the specific token.
The function simply returns the YUSD debt snapshot value for the given borrower and token.

Summary:
The `getRewardSnapshotYUSD` function allows external callers to retrieve the YUSD debt snapshot for a specific borrower and token by accessing the corresponding entry in the `rewardSnapshots` mapping. The function provides transparency regarding the YUSD debt obligations of borrowers for different tokens.
