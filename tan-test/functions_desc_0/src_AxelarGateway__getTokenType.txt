This code defines an internal function named `_getTokenType`, which is responsible for returning the `TokenType` of a token based on its symbol. The function accepts a single parameter `symbol`, which is a string representing the symbol of the token. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `symbol`: A string that represents the symbol of the token for which the `TokenType` needs to be determined.

Return Value:
The function returns a value of type `TokenType`, which is obtained by converting the value stored at the key generated by `_getTokenTypeKey(symbol)` to the `TokenType` enum.

Code Breakdown:
The function `_getTokenType` is an internal function, meaning it can only be accessed within the contract or its derived contracts. It accepts a single parameter `symbol` of type `string`, which represents the symbol of the token. Within the function, `_getTokenTypeKey(symbol)` is called to generate a key based on the provided `symbol`. This key is then used to retrieve a value from storage using the `getUint` function. The value retrieved from storage is then converted to the `TokenType` enum using a typecast, and this value is returned as the result of the function.

Summary:
The `_getTokenType` function takes a token symbol as input, generates a key based on the symbol, retrieves the corresponding value from storage, and converts it to the `TokenType` enum before returning it as the output of the function.
