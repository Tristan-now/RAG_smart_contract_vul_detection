This code defines a private view function named `_equivalentCollateral`, which calculates the equivalent collateral token amount needed for a given borrow token amount. The function accepts three parameters: the address of the collateral asset (`_collateralAsset`), the address of the borrow asset (`_borrowAsset`), and the amount of borrow tokens (`_borrowTokenAmount`). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_collateralAsset`: The address of the collateral asset.
2. `_borrowAsset`: The address of the borrow asset.
3. `_borrowTokenAmount`: The amount of borrow tokens.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the equivalent collateral token amount.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `_collateralAsset`, `_borrowAsset`, and `_borrowTokenAmount`. `_equivalentCollateral` is a private view function, meaning it can only be called internally and does not modify the state of the contract. Within the function, a tuple `_ratioOfPrices` and `_decimals` is declared and assigned the return values of the `getLatestPrice` function from the `PRICE_ORACLE` contract. This function retrieves the latest price ratio between the collateral asset and the borrow asset, as well as the number of decimals used in the price calculation.

Next, the `_collateralTokenAmount` is calculated by multiplying the `_borrowTokenAmount` by 10 raised to the power of `_decimals`, and then dividing the result by `_ratioOfPrices`. This calculation determines the equivalent amount of collateral tokens needed to cover the specified borrow token amount based on the price ratio and decimals obtained from the price oracle.

Finally, the function returns the calculated `_collateralTokenAmount`, which represents the equivalent collateral token amount required for the given borrow token amount.

Summary:
The `_equivalentCollateral` function utilizes the price information obtained from the `PRICE_ORACLE` contract to calculate the equivalent collateral token amount needed for a specified borrow token amount. By applying the price ratio and decimals, the function ensures proper collateralization based on the current market prices of the assets involved.
