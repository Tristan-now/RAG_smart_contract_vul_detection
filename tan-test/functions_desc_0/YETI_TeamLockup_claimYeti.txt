This code defines an external function named `claimYeti`, which allows a designated multisig address to claim vested YETI tokens. The function includes several requirements and calculations to determine the amount of YETI tokens that can be claimed at a given time. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_amount`: An unsigned integer representing the amount of YETI tokens to be claimed.

Modifiers:
- `onlyMultisig`: This modifier restricts the execution of the function to only the designated multisig address.

Requirements:
1. `block.timestamp > vestingStart`: Ensures that the current block timestamp is greater than the specified vesting start time.
2. `totalClaimed < totalVest`: Checks if the total amount of YETI tokens claimed is less than the total vested YETI tokens.

Variables:
- `timePastVesting`: Calculates the time elapsed since the vesting start time.
- `available`: Calculates the available YETI tokens that can be claimed based on the vesting schedule.

Logic:
1. The function calculates the `available` YETI tokens that can be claimed at the current time based on the vesting schedule. This calculation considers the total vested YETI tokens, the time elapsed since the vesting start, and the vesting length.
2. If the calculated `available` tokens are greater than or equal to the total claimed tokens plus the `_amount` specified for claiming, the function proceeds to claim the YETI tokens.
3. If the condition is met, the function increments the `totalClaimed` variable by the `_amount` claimed and transfers the specified `_amount` of YETI tokens to the multisig address using the `YETI.transfer` function.
4. If the condition is not met, the function does not allow the claim to proceed.

Summary:
The `claimYeti` function allows the multisig address to claim vested YETI tokens based on the vesting schedule and the specified claiming amount. It ensures that the vesting period has started, there are still available YETI tokens to claim, and the claimed amount does not exceed the available tokens. If all conditions are met, the function transfers the claimed YETI tokens to the multisig address.
