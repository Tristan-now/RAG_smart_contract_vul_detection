This code snippet defines an internal function named `_burn` that overrides a function from a parent contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_id`: A `uint256` variable representing the unique identifier of the bond to be burned.

Code Breakdown:
The `_burn` function is marked as `internal` and is declared to override a function from the parent contract. Within the function, the `_idToBond` mapping is accessed using the `_id` parameter, and the corresponding bond data is deleted from the mapping using the `delete` keyword. This operation effectively removes the bond associated with the given `_id`.

Next, the `super._burn(_id)` statement is called to invoke the `_burn` function from the parent contract. This allows the parent contract to perform any additional logic related to burning the bond.

Summary:
The `_burn` function deletes the bond data associated with the given `_id` from the `_idToBond` mapping and then calls the `_burn` function from the parent contract to complete the burning process.
