This code defines a private function named `_forwardDaiPermit` that facilitates the approval of spending Dai tokens on behalf of the user. The function takes in several parameters to execute this approval process. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `addresses`: A struct named `PoolAddresses` that contains addresses related to the pool.
2. `spender`: The address that is being approved to spend Dai tokens on behalf of the user.
3. `nonce`: A unique number used to prevent replay attacks.
4. `deadline`: A timestamp indicating until when the permit is valid.
5. `allowed`: A boolean value indicating whether the spender is allowed to spend Dai tokens.
6. `v`, `r`, `s`: Parameters used in the ECDSA signature to validate the permit.

Code Breakdown:
The function `_forwardDaiPermit` is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract itself. The function uses the `DaiAbstract` interface to interact with the Dai token contract. It calls the `permit` function of the Dai token contract, passing in the necessary parameters to approve the spender to spend Dai tokens on behalf of the user. The parameters include the user's address (`msg.sender`), the spender's address (`spender`), the nonce, deadline, permission status (`allowed`), and the ECDSA signature components (`v`, `r`, `s`).

Summary:
The `_forwardDaiPermit` function acts as a proxy for permitting the spending of Dai tokens by a designated spender on behalf of the user. It leverages the `permit` function of the Dai token contract to execute this approval process securely.
