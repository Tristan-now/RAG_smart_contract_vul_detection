This code snippet defines a public virtual function named `burnFrom` that allows the owner of the contract to burn a specified amount of tokens from a specific account. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account`: The address of the account from which tokens will be burned.
2. `amount`: The amount of tokens to be burned from the specified account.

Functionality:
The `burnFrom` function is a public function, meaning it can be called externally by anyone. However, the `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that only the owner of the contract can execute this function. The function takes two parameters: `account`, which is the address of the account from which tokens will be burned, and `amount`, which specifies the number of tokens to be burned.

Within the function, the `_burn` function is called with the `account` and `amount` parameters. The `_burn` function is presumably a function defined elsewhere in the contract or inherited from a parent contract, and it is responsible for actually burning the specified amount of tokens from the specified account.

Summary:
The `burnFrom` function provides a way for the contract owner to burn tokens from a specific account. By calling the `_burn` function with the specified account and amount, the function effectively reduces the token balance of the specified account by the specified amount, thereby burning those tokens.
