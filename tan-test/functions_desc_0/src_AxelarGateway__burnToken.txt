This code defines an internal function named `_burnToken` that is responsible for burning tokens. The function takes two parameters: a string `symbol` representing the token symbol and a bytes32 `salt` value. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `symbol`: A string representing the symbol of the token to be burned.
2. `salt`: A bytes32 value used for additional security or uniqueness in the burning process.

Code Breakdown:
1. The function first retrieves the address of the token based on the provided symbol using the `tokenAddresses` function. If the token address is 0 (meaning the token does not exist), it reverts with a `TokenDoesNotExist` error.
2. It then checks the type of the token using the `_getTokenType` function. If the token is of type `External`, it proceeds with the external burning process. If it's not an external token, it directly burns the token using the `BurnableMintableCappedERC20` contract.
3. For external tokens, the function creates a new `DepositHandler` contract instance with a specified `salt` value. This `DepositHandler` contract is used to facilitate the burning process for external tokens.
4. The function then calls the `execute` function of the `DepositHandler` contract, passing the token address and the encoded data for transferring the token balance to the contract.
5. If the execution is successful and there are no errors in the return data, the burning process continues. Otherwise, it reverts with a `BurnFailed` error.
6. After successfully burning the external token, the `DepositHandler` contract is destroyed to clean up the resources.
7. If the token is not of type `External`, the function directly calls the `burn` function of the `BurnableMintableCappedERC20` contract to burn the token with the specified `salt`.

Summary:
The `_burnToken` function handles the burning process for tokens based on the provided symbol and `salt`. It distinguishes between external and non-external tokens, utilizing a `DepositHandler` contract for external token burning and directly interacting with the token contract for non-external tokens. The function ensures the secure and successful burning of tokens based on their type and executes the necessary steps accordingly.
