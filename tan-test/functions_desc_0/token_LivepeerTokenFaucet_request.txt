This code defines an external function named `request` that allows an address to request a transfer of tokens. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `msg.sender`: The address of the caller making the request.
2. `isWhitelisted`: A mapping that stores whether an address is whitelisted or not.
3. `nextValidRequest`: A mapping that stores the timestamp of the next valid request for each address.
4. `block.timestamp`: The current timestamp of the block.
5. `requestWait`: A variable that determines the wait time between requests.
6. `token`: An ERC20 token contract instance.
7. `requestAmount`: The amount of tokens to be transferred in each request.

Events:
1. `Request`: An event emitted when a request is made, containing the address of the requester and the amount of tokens requested.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `external` visibility specifier, indicating that the function can be called from outside the contract. The `validRequest` modifier is applied to ensure that only valid requests can be processed.

Within the function, there is a conditional check to determine if the caller (`msg.sender`) is whitelisted. If the caller is not whitelisted, the `nextValidRequest` mapping is updated to set the next valid request time for that address to the current timestamp plus the specified `requestWait` duration in hours.

Regardless of the whitelist status, the function then transfers `requestAmount` tokens from the contract to the caller using the `token.transfer` function.

Finally, an `emit` statement is used to trigger the `Request` event, providing the caller's address and the amount of tokens requested as parameters.

Summary:
The `request` function allows an address to request a transfer of tokens from the contract. If the requester is not whitelisted, a cooldown period is enforced before the next request can be made. The requested tokens are then transferred to the requester, and an event is emitted to log the request details.
