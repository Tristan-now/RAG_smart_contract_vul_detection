This code snippet defines an external function named `setToken` that allows the contract owner to set a new token address. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_newToken`: This parameter is of type `address` and represents the new token address that the owner wants to set.

Functionality:
The `setToken` function is marked as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function is also marked with the `override` keyword, indicating that it overrides a function from an inherited interface.

Within the function, the `_newToken` address is used to create an instance of the `IERC20` interface, casting it to the `token` variable. This means that the contract will interact with the ERC20 token at the specified address.

Access Control:
The `onlyOwner` modifier is applied to the function, ensuring that only the owner of the contract can call this function. This is a common access control pattern in Solidity to restrict certain functions to specific roles.

Overall, the `setToken` function provides a way for the contract owner to update the token address that the contract will interact with, enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the smart contract.
