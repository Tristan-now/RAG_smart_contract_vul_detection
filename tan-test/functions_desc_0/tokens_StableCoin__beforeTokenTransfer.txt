This code snippet defines an internal function named `_beforeTokenTransfer` that overrides the same function from two parent contracts, `ERC20` and `ERC20Pausable`. The function is triggered before a token transfer occurs and performs certain actions. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred.
2. `to`: The address to which the tokens are being transferred.
3. `amount`: The amount of tokens being transferred.

Code Breakdown:
The `_beforeTokenTransfer` function is an internal virtual function, meaning it can only be accessed within the contract or its derived contracts, and it can be overridden by child contracts.
Within the function, `super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);` is called to invoke the same function from the parent contracts `ERC20` and `ERC20Pausable`. This ensures that any logic implemented in the parent contracts related to token transfers is executed before the custom logic in this contract.
By calling `super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);`, the function ensures that the token transfer is paused or any other checks defined in the parent contracts are enforced before proceeding with the transfer.
The function does not contain any additional custom logic beyond calling the parent contract's `_beforeTokenTransfer` function.

Summary:
The `_beforeTokenTransfer` function in this contract serves as a hook that is triggered before a token transfer takes place. By calling the same function from the parent contracts `ERC20` and `ERC20Pausable`, it ensures that any necessary checks or actions defined in those contracts are carried out before the token transfer is completed.
