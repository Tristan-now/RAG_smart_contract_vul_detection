This code defines an external view function named `balanceOf` that returns the balance of a specific account. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account`: The address of the account for which the balance needs to be retrieved.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the balance of the specified account.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameter `account`, which is the address of the account for which the balance is being queried. The function is marked as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. It is also marked as `view`, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract.

Within the function, `_balances[account]` is used to access the balance of the specified account. The `_balances` mapping is assumed to be a mapping defined elsewhere in the contract that maps addresses to their respective balances.

The function simply returns the balance of the specified account using `_balances[account]`.

Summary:
The `balanceOf` function allows external callers to query and retrieve the balance of a specific account by providing the account's address. It accesses the balance from a mapping within the contract and returns the balance as a `uint256` value.
