This code defines an internal function named `safeTransferETH`, which is responsible for transferring a specified amount of Ether to a recipient address safely. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `recipient`: The address of the recipient to whom the Ether will be transferred.
2. `amount`: The amount of Ether to be transferred.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `recipient` and `amount`. `safeTransferETH` is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function uses the `recipient.call{value: amount}("")` syntax to transfer Ether to the `recipient` address. This syntax is used to call the `recipient` address and transfer the specified `amount` of Ether. The function returns a tuple `(bool success, )`, where `success` indicates whether the transfer was successful or not. The `require` statement is used to check if the transfer was successful. If the transfer fails (i.e., `success` is false), the function reverts with an error message "ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED".

Summary:
The `safeTransferETH` function facilitates the safe transfer of Ether to a specified recipient address. It uses the `recipient.call{value: amount}("")` syntax to transfer the Ether and checks the success of the transfer using a `require` statement. If the transfer fails, the function reverts with an error message.
