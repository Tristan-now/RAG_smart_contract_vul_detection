This code snippet defines an external function named `setExposure` that allows the contract owner to set a new exposure address. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_exposure`: This is the address of the new exposure contract that the owner wants to set. It must not be the zero address.

Functionality:
- The function first checks if the provided exposure address is not the zero address using the `require` statement. If the address is the zero address, the function will revert with the error message "Zero address provided".
- If the provided exposure address is valid, the function sets the `exposure` variable to the new exposure address by casting it to the `IExposure` interface. This assumes that `IExposure` is an interface that the exposure contract implements.
- After setting the exposure address, the function emits a `LogNewExposure` event with the new exposure address as the parameter.

Summary:
The `setExposure` function allows the contract owner to update the exposure contract address. It performs input validation to ensure that a valid address is provided and then updates the exposure address in the contract state. Finally, it emits an event to log the change in exposure address.
