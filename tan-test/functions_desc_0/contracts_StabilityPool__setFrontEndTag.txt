This code defines an internal function named `_setFrontEndTag`, which is responsible for setting the front-end tag for a specific depositor. The function takes two parameters: `_depositor`, which is the address of the depositor, and `_frontEndTag`, which is the front-end tag to be set for that depositor. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_depositor`: The address of the depositor for whom the front-end tag is being set.
2. `_frontEndTag`: The front-end tag that will be set for the depositor.

Code Breakdown:
The function `_setFrontEndTag` is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. Within the function, the front-end tag for the specified depositor is set by accessing the `deposits` mapping using the `_depositor` address as the key and assigning the `_frontEndTag` value to the `frontEndTag` field of the corresponding `Deposit` struct. This effectively updates the front-end tag for the depositor.
After setting the front-end tag, the function emits an `FrontEndTagSet` event, providing the `_depositor` address and the `_frontEndTag` value as parameters. This event can be used to track and log changes to the front-end tags within the contract.

Summary:
The `_setFrontEndTag` function allows for the setting of front-end tags for specific depositors within the contract. By updating the `frontEndTag` field in the `deposits` mapping, the function enables the association of front-end tags with depositors, providing a way to categorize and differentiate depositors based on their front-end tags.
