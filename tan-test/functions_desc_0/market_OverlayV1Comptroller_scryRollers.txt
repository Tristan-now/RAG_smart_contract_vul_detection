This code defines an internal function named `scryRollers`, which is used to search for specific data points within an array of `Roller` structs. The function takes in three parameters: an array of `Roller` structs (`rollers`), an integer `_cycloid`, and an integer `_target`. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `rollers`: An array of `Roller` structs that stores data points.
2. `_cycloid`: An integer representing a specific index within the `rollers` array.
3. `_target`: An integer representing the target value to search for within the `rollers` array.

Return Values:
- `beforeOrAt_`: A `Roller` struct that represents the data point before or at the target value.
- `atOrAfter_`: A `Roller` struct that represents the data point at or after the target value.

Code Breakdown:
- The function initializes the `beforeOrAt_` variable with the `Roller` struct at the `_cycloid` index within the `rollers` array.
- It then checks if the `time` value of `beforeOrAt_` is less than or equal to the `_target`. If true, it handles the case where the target is at or after the newest roller.
- If the `time` value of `beforeOrAt_` is equal to the `_target`, it returns both `beforeOrAt_` and an empty `atOrAfter_` struct.
- If the `time` value of `beforeOrAt_` is less than the `_target`, it sets the `atOrAfter_` struct with the current block timestamp, `ying`, and `yang` values from `beforeOrAt_`.
- If the target is not at or after the newest roller, the function updates the `_cycloid` index to point to the next roller in the array.
- It then retrieves the `Roller` struct at the updated `_cycloid` index and handles the case where the `time` value is less than or equal to 1.
- If the `_target` is less than or equal to the `time` value of the new `beforeOrAt_`, it returns both `beforeOrAt_` and an empty `atOrAfter_` struct.
- Otherwise, it calls the `binarySearch` function to perform a binary search within the `rollers` array to find the data points before and after the target value.

Summary:
The `scryRollers` function is used to search for specific data points within an array of `Roller` structs. It handles cases where the target value is at or after the newest roller, updates the index to the next roller if needed, and performs a binary search to find the data points before and after the target value.
