This code defines a function named `fetchPricePoint` that calculates and returns a `PricePoint` struct. The function retrieves price and liquidity information from two different Uniswap V3 pools (marketFeed and ovlFeed) and computes the price point based on the gathered data. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- `price_`: A `PricePoint` struct containing the microTick, macroTick, and computed depth values.

Code Breakdown:
1. The function initializes several variables to store price and liquidity data: `_ticks` and `_liqs` for tick and liquidity values, `_ovlPrice` for the OVL price, and `_marketLiquidity` for market liquidity.
2. The function then defines two separate blocks of code enclosed in curly braces. Each block retrieves data from a different Uniswap V3 pool and calculates specific values.
3. The first block of code retrieves tick and liquidity data from the `marketFeed` pool using the `observe` function. It calculates the microTick and macroTick values based on the retrieved tick data and computes the square root price and liquidity.
4. The second block of code retrieves tick data from the `ovlFeed` pool and calculates the OVL price using the `getQuoteAtTick` function from the `OracleLibraryV2`.
5. Finally, the function constructs a `PricePoint` struct using the calculated microTick, macroTick, and the result of the `computeDepth` function, which computes the depth based on market liquidity and OVL price.
6. The function returns the `PricePoint` struct as the output of the `fetchPricePoint` function.

Summary:
The `fetchPricePoint` function fetches price and liquidity data from two Uniswap V3 pools, calculates various values such as microTick, macroTick, market liquidity, and OVL price, and constructs a `PricePoint` struct based on these calculations. The function then returns this `PricePoint` struct as the final result.
