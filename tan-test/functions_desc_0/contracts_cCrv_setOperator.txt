This code defines an external function named `setOperator` that allows changing the operator address. The function requires the caller to be the current operator to authorize the change. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_operator`: The new address that will be set as the operator.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameter `_operator`, which is the address of the new operator. `setOperator` is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function first checks the authorization by using the `require` statement. It verifies that the `msg.sender` (the caller of the function) is equal to the current `operator` address. If the condition is not met (the caller is not the current operator), the function reverts with the error message `!auth`. If the condition is satisfied, the function updates the `operator` address with the new `_operator` address provided as an argument.

Summary:
The `setOperator` function allows changing the operator address, but only the current operator can authorize this change. If the caller is not the current operator, the function reverts with an error message. Otherwise, the function updates the operator address to the new address provided as an argument.
