This code snippet defines an internal function named `_doTransferIn` that overrides a parent function. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `from`: The address from which the transfer is initiated.
2. `amount`: The amount of tokens being transferred.

Code Breakdown:
The function `_doTransferIn` is marked as `internal` and is declared as an override, indicating that it overrides a function from a parent contract. Within the function, there are two `require` statements that enforce certain conditions:
1. `require(msg.sender == from, Error.INVALID_SENDER)`: This statement ensures that the sender of the transaction is the same as the `from` address provided as a parameter. If the condition is not met, it will revert the transaction with the error message `Error.INVALID_SENDER`.
2. `require(msg.value == amount, Error.INVALID_AMOUNT)`: This statement checks if the value sent with the transaction matches the `amount` parameter. If the values do not match, the transaction will revert with the error message `Error.INVALID_AMOUNT`.

Summary:
The `_doTransferIn` function is responsible for validating the sender of the transaction and the amount of value sent with the transaction. It ensures that the sender matches the specified `from` address and that the value sent matches the `amount` parameter. If any of these conditions are not met, the transaction will be reverted with an appropriate error message.
