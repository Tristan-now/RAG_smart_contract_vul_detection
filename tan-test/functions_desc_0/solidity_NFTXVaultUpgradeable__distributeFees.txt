This code defines an internal virtual function named `_distributeFees`, which is responsible for distributing fees to a fee receiver and triggering the distribution process. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `amount`: A `uint256` value representing the amount of fees to be distributed.

Code Breakdown:
The function `_distributeFees` is marked as internal and virtual, meaning it can only be accessed within the contract or its derived contracts, and it can be overridden by functions in derived contracts.
Within the function, there is a conditional check to ensure that the `amount` to be distributed is greater than 0. If the `amount` is greater than 0, the function proceeds with the fee distribution process.
The address of the fee receiver is obtained by calling the `feeReceiver` function from the `vaultFactory` contract and storing it in the `feeReceiver` variable.
Next, the `_mint` function is called to mint the specified `amount` of tokens to the `feeReceiver`. This effectively transfers the fees to the fee receiver's address.
After minting the fees, the function calls the `distribute` function on the `INFTXFeeDistributor` contract, passing the `vaultId` as a parameter. This triggers the distribution process, where the fees are distributed according to the logic implemented in the `INFTXFeeDistributor` contract.

Summary:
The `_distributeFees` function is responsible for minting fees to the fee receiver's address and triggering the distribution process by calling the `distribute` function on the `INFTXFeeDistributor` contract. This function ensures that fees are distributed correctly and efficiently within the system.
