This code snippet defines a public view function named `getUnactivatedStakersPoolBalance` that is part of a contract implementing an interface with a function named `getUnactivatedStakersPoolBalance`. The function takes an `IERC20` token interface as a parameter and returns a `uint256` value representing the stake balance stored in the contract's `baseData`.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_token`: An `IERC20` token interface representing the token for which the unactivated stakers pool balance is being retrieved.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the stake balance stored in the contract's `baseData`.

Code Breakdown:
The `getUnactivatedStakersPoolBalance` function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract's state.
The function takes an `IERC20` token interface `_token` as a parameter, which is used to specify the token for which the unactivated stakers pool balance is being retrieved.
Within the function, the `baseData().stakeBalance` is accessed to retrieve the stake balance stored in the contract's `baseData`.
The function then returns this stake balance as a `uint256` value to the caller.

Summary:
The `getUnactivatedStakersPoolBalance` function provides a way to retrieve the unactivated stakers pool balance for a specific token by accessing the stake balance stored in the contract's `baseData` and returning it as a `uint256` value.
