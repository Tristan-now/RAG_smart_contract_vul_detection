This code snippet defines an internal function named `_authorizeUpgrade` that is used for authorizing an upgrade to a new implementation contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `newImplementation`: This parameter is of type `address` and represents the address of the new implementation contract that is being authorized for upgrade.

Function Signature:
The `_authorizeUpgrade` function is marked as `internal`, meaning it can only be accessed within the contract or its derived contracts. It overrides a function from the parent contract and is restricted to be called only by the contract owner, as indicated by the `onlyOwner` modifier.

Code Breakdown:
The `_authorizeUpgrade` function does not contain any specific logic or functionality within its body. It serves as a placeholder function that can be customized by the contract developer to include authorization logic for upgrading to a new implementation. In this case, the function is empty, and it simply acts as a hook that can be extended in derived contracts to implement specific authorization checks before allowing an upgrade to a new implementation.

Summary:
The `_authorizeUpgrade` function is an internal function that is meant to be overridden in derived contracts to provide authorization logic for upgrading to a new implementation. It enforces that only the contract owner can trigger the upgrade process, but the actual authorization logic needs to be implemented in the derived contracts by extending this function.
