This code defines an internal function named `_transfer`, which is responsible for transferring a specific token (`id`) from one address (`from`) to another address (`to`). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `from`: The address from which the token is being transferred.
2. `to`: The address to which the token is being transferred.
3. `id`: The unique identifier of the token being transferred.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `from`, `to`, and `id`. `_transfer` is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function first checks if the `from` address is the current owner of the token with the specified `id`. If the condition is not met, it reverts with the error message "WRONG_FROM".

Next, it checks if the `to` address is not the zero address (address(0)). If the `to` address is the zero address, it reverts with the error message "INVALID_RECIPIENT".

The function then performs the token transfer by updating the balances of the `from` and `to` addresses. It decrements the balance of the `from` address by 1 and increments the balance of the `to` address by 1. This operation is done using unchecked arithmetic to avoid overflow/underflow issues.

After updating the balances, the function updates the ownership of the token `id` to the `to` address.

It then deletes any approval for the token `id` by removing the approval mapping entry for that token.

Finally, the function emits a `Transfer` event to notify external systems about the token transfer, including the `from` address, `to` address, and the `id` of the token being transferred.

Summary:
The `_transfer` function ensures that the token transfer is valid by checking ownership, verifying the recipient address, updating balances, ownership, and approvals accordingly, and emitting a transfer event to notify external systems about the transaction.
