This code defines an internal function named `modexp` that performs modular exponentiation. The function takes three parameters: `base`, `exponent`, and `modulus`, all of type `bytes`. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `base`: The base value for the modular exponentiation operation.
2. `exponent`: The exponent value for the modular exponentiation operation.
3. `modulus`: The modulus value for the modular exponentiation operation.

Return Value:
The function returns a tuple consisting of a boolean `success` and a `bytes` array `output`. The `success` variable indicates whether the modular exponentiation operation was successful, and the `output` variable stores the result of the operation.

Code Breakdown:
The function first encodes the input parameters (`base`, `exponent`, and `modulus`) into a single `bytes` array named `input` using `abi.encodePacked`. The encoded input includes the lengths of the `base`, `exponent`, and `modulus` arrays followed by the actual data.
A new `bytes` array named `output` is created with a length equal to the length of the `modulus` array. This array will store the result of the modular exponentiation operation.
The `assembly` block is used to execute low-level inline assembly code. Within the assembly block:
- The `staticcall` function is used to perform a read-only call to a contract at address 5 with the input data specified by `input`. The `gas()` function provides the available gas for the call.
- The result of the `staticcall` operation is stored in the `success` variable, indicating whether the operation was successful.
- The output data from the operation is stored starting at the memory location `add(output, 32)` with a length specified by `mload(modulus)`.
- The `add` and `mload` functions are used to access and load data from specific memory locations.

Summary:
The `modexp` function encodes the input parameters, performs modular exponentiation using inline assembly, and returns the success status along with the result of the operation. This function is designed to handle modular exponentiation operations efficiently within a smart contract environment.
