This code defines a private function named `transferSplitAsset` that attempts to transfer a specified amount of a token (referred to as `splitAsset`) to a given recipient address. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `to`: The address to which the token should be transferred.
2. `value`: The amount of the token to transfer.

Return Value:
`didSucceed`: A boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful or not.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `to` and `value`, specifying the recipient address and the amount of the token to transfer, respectively. The function returns a boolean variable `didSucceed`, which indicates whether the transfer operation was successful or not.

Within the function, there is an attempt to transfer the specified amount of the token `splitAsset` to the recipient address `to` using the `transfer` function of the `IERC20` interface. The result of this transfer operation is stored in the `didSucceed` variable.

A `require` statement is used to ensure that the transfer operation was successful. If the transfer fails, the function will revert with the error message "Failed to transfer ETH".

Finally, an `emit` statement is used to trigger an event named `TransferETH`, which logs information about the transfer operation, including the recipient address, the amount transferred, and whether the transfer was successful.

Summary:
The `transferSplitAsset` function attempts to transfer a specified amount of the `splitAsset` token to a given recipient address. It checks the success of the transfer operation, reverts if the transfer fails, and emits an event to log details of the transfer.
