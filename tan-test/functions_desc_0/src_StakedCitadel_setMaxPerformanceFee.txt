This code defines an external function named `setMaxPerformanceFee`, which allows only the governance address to set the maximum performance fee that can be charged. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_fees`: A `uint256` value representing the maximum performance fee that can be set.

Return Value:
This function does not return any value.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameter `_fees`, which is the new maximum performance fee to be set. The function modifier `_onlyGovernance()` ensures that only the governance address can call this function. 
The `require` statement checks if the `_fees` value is less than or equal to the `PERFORMANCE_FEE_HARD_CAP`. If it is not, the function will revert with the error message "performanceFeeStrategist too high".
If the `_fees` value is within the acceptable range, the `maxPerformanceFee` variable is updated with the new value `_fees`.
An event `SetMaxPerformanceFee` is emitted to log the successful update of the maximum performance fee.

Summary:
The `setMaxPerformanceFee` function allows the governance address to set the maximum performance fee that can be charged, ensuring that it does not exceed the predefined hard cap. This function provides a way to adjust the fee structure within the smart contract while maintaining proper governance control.
