This code defines an external view function named `calculateRemoveLiquidityOneToken`, which calculates the available token amount that can be withdrawn by a specific account when removing liquidity for a single token. The function accepts three parameters: the address of the account (`account`), the amount of the token to be removed (`tokenAmount`), and the index of the token (`tokenIndex`). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account`: The address of the account for which the liquidity is being removed.
2. `tokenAmount`: The amount of the token to be removed from the liquidity pool.
3. `tokenIndex`: The index of the token in the liquidity pool.

Return Value:
`availableTokenAmount`: The function returns a `uint256` value representing the available amount of the token that can be withdrawn.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `account`, `tokenAmount`, and `tokenIndex`. `calculateRemoveLiquidityOneToken` is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the contract. The function calls the `calculateWithdrawOneToken` function of the `swapStorage` contract to calculate the available token amount that can be withdrawn. It assigns the returned value of `availableTokenAmount` to the variable of the same name. The `calculateWithdrawOneToken` function is assumed to be defined in the `swapStorage` contract and is responsible for calculating the available token amount to be withdrawn based on the provided parameters: `account`, `tokenAmount`, and `tokenIndex`.

Summary:
The `calculateRemoveLiquidityOneToken` function provides a convenient way to calculate the available token amount that can be withdrawn by a specific account when removing liquidity for a single token. It delegates the actual calculation to the `calculateWithdrawOneToken` function of the `swapStorage` contract and returns the result as the available token amount.
