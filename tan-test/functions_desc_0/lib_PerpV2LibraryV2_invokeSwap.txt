This code defines a public function named `invokeSwap` that facilitates swapping tokens using a SetToken. The function takes three parameters: an `ISetToken` instance `_setToken`, an `IQuoter` instance `_quoter`, and a `SwapParams` struct `_params`. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_setToken`: An instance of the `ISetToken` interface representing the SetToken used for the swap.
2. `_quoter`: An instance of the `IQuoter` interface representing the Quoter contract used for quoting swap prices.
3. `_params`: A `SwapParams` struct containing parameters required for the swap operation.

Return Value:
The function returns an `IQuoter.SwapResponse` struct representing the response of the swap operation.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `_setToken`, `_quoter`, and `_params`. The function is public, meaning it can be called externally. Inside the function, a call is made to the `getSwapCalldata` function to retrieve the swap calldata required for the swap operation. The `getSwapCalldata` function returns three values, but only the `swapCalldata` is used in this function. The `swapCalldata` contains the necessary data for the swap operation. Next, the `invoke` function of the `_setToken` contract is called with the `_quoter` address, a value of 0, and the `swapCalldata`. This function call executes the swap operation using the provided parameters. The return value of the `invoke` function call is stored in `returnValue`, which is then decoded using `abi.decode` to convert it into an `IQuoter.SwapResponse` struct. Finally, the decoded `SwapResponse` struct is returned as the output of the `invokeSwap` function.

Summary:
The `invokeSwap` function facilitates token swapping using a SetToken by interacting with a Quoter contract. It retrieves the necessary swap calldata, invokes the swap operation on the SetToken contract, and returns the response of the swap operation as an `IQuoter.SwapResponse` struct.
