This code defines an internal function named `add`, which performs addition of two `uint128` numbers and checks for overflow. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `a`: A `uint128` number representing the first operand of the addition.
2. `b`: A `uint128` number representing the second operand of the addition.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint128` value representing the result of the addition operation.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `a` and `b`. `add` is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function performs addition of `a` and `b` and stores the result in a `uint128` variable named `c`. It then checks if the result `c` is greater than or equal to the original value of `a` to ensure that no overflow occurred during the addition operation. If an overflow is detected, the function reverts with an error message stating "LiquitySafeMath128: addition overflow". If no overflow occurs, the function returns the result `c`.

Summary:
The `add` function adds two `uint128` numbers `a` and `b`, checks for overflow, and returns the result of the addition operation. It ensures that the addition operation does not result in an overflow, providing a safe way to perform arithmetic operations on `uint128` numbers.
