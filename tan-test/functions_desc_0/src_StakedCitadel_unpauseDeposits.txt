This code defines an external function named `unpauseDeposits`, which allows only the governance address to unpause deposits. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. None

Return Value:
None

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `external` visibility specifier, indicating that the function can be called from outside the contract. Within the function, the `_onlyGovernance()` modifier is called to ensure that only the governance address can unpause deposits. If the caller is not the governance address, the function will revert.
Once the modifier check is passed, the `pausedDeposit` state variable is set to `false`, indicating that deposits are no longer paused. An event `UnpauseDeposits` is emitted with the `msg.sender` as the parameter to log the unpause action.
Summary:
The `unpauseDeposits` function allows the governance address to unpause deposits by setting the `pausedDeposit` state variable to `false`. This function ensures that only authorized users can control the deposit pausing mechanism in the contract.
