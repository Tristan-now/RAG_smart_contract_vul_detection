This code defines an external function named `removeLiquidity`, which allows only the guardian to remove liquidity from a pool. The function takes two parameters: `_steps` and `_burningLPs`, representing the number of steps to remove liquidity and the amount of LP tokens to burn, respectively. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_steps`: A `uint256` value indicating the number of steps to remove liquidity.
2. `_burningLPs`: A `uint256` value representing the amount of LP tokens to burn.

Functionality:
- The function calculates the total amount of liquidity to be removed by multiplying `_steps` with a variable `step` (which is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract).
- It then creates a fixed-size array `amounts` with two elements, both initialized to the calculated `removingLiquidity` value.
- Finally, the function calls the `remove_liquidity` function of the `usdm3crv` contract, passing `_burningLPs` and the `amounts` array as parameters to remove the specified amount of liquidity.

Overall, this function allows the guardian to remove liquidity from the pool by burning a specified amount of LP tokens and withdrawing the corresponding assets in proportion to the LP tokens burned.
