Type of vulnerability: Wrong trading pricing calculations
Cause of vulnerability: Agent spamming a high amount of trades at an arbitrary price
Execution process: Agent creates a high amount of orders with near-zero amounts at an arbitrary price, pairs orders with another account, calls Trader.executeTrade which calls Pricing.recordTrade using the arbitrary price set by the agent, skewing the average price calculation
Detailed characteristics: Vulnerability allows manipulation of trading prices by spamming trades at arbitrary prices, skewing average price calculation used for funding rates and fair price
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function recordTrade(uint256 fillAmount) public {
    // Record trade with fillAmount
}
```
