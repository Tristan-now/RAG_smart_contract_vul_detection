Type of vulnerability: Self transfer vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: The transfer_share_and_rewards function allows for self transfer, enabling users to increase their share/rewards balance by transferring shares and rewards to themselves.
Execution process: Users can invoke the transfer_share_and_rewards function to transfer shares and rewards to themselves, effectively doubling their share/reward balance.
Detailed characteristics: The transfer_share_and_rewards function does not include a check to prevent self-transfers, allowing users to exploit this functionality and manipulate their share/reward balances.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function transfer_share_and_rewards(address from, address to, uint amount, address who) public {
    require(who != from, "Cannot transfer to self");
    // Transfer logic
}
```
