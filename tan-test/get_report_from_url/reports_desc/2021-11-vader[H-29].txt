Execution process: Frontrunners manipulate the pool's reserves to devalue the LP's provided liquidity, extract value, and return the reserves back to normal
Detailed characteristics: Users can provide liquidity in any ratio without specifying a minimum number of liquidity units, allowing potential manipulation by frontrunners
