Type of vulnerability: Unhandled return value in transfer function
Cause of vulnerability: Failure to handle return value of transfer function which could be false on failure
Execution process: The transferOut function in Pools.sol calls the transfer function on a user-supplied untrusted token address without checking the return value
Detailed characteristics: Lack of handling return value of transfer function, potential for malicious token implementation
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function transferOut(address token, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount); // This transfer call does not handle the return value
}
```
