Type of vulnerability: Unused slippage params
Cause of vulnerability: Function addLiquidity in VaderRouter (both V1 and V2) does not use slippage parameters.
Execution process: The lack of slippage parameters in the addLiquidity function makes the contract vulnerable to sandwich attacks and MEV.
Detailed characteristics: Lack of consideration for slippage parameters in the function addLiquidity increases the risk of manipulation attacks from mempool snipers.
Vulnerable code:
```
uint256,// amountAMin = unused
uint256,// amountBMin = unused
```
