Cause of vulnerability: Chainlink price feeds have acceptable deviations that can be exploited for arbitrage opportunities.
Execution process: By manipulating the price oracles for different assets, users can deposit the minimally-priced asset and withdraw more value from the deposit pool.
Detailed characteristics: The vulnerability arises from the significant deviations in the Chainlink price feeds, allowing for profitable arbitrage opportunities to be exploited.
Vulnerable code: 
```

LRTOracleMock(stETHPriceOracle).submitNewAssetPrice(stETHNewPrice);
LRTOracleMock(cbETHPriceOracle).submitNewAssetPrice(cbETHNewPrice);
