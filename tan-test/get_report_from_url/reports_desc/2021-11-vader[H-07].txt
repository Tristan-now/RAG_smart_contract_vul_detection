Type of vulnerability: Non-AMM price oracle manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: VaderReserve only allows a single router to claim IL protection on behalf of users, resulting in locked funds for liquidity providers.
Execution process: Only one router (either VaderRouter or VaderRouterV2) can claim IL protection on VaderReserve, causing liquidity deployed to VaderPool or VaderPoolV2 to be permanently locked.
Detailed characteristics: The vulnerability prevents LPs from removing liquidity as the call to the reserve will revert, and Vader governance cannot update the allowed router on VaderReserve.
