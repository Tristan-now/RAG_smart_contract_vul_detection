Type of vulnerability: AMM price oracle manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of validation in the address parameter of the function setFallbackHandler()
Execution process: Attacker sets the fallback handler address of the safe to be the address of the token he wants to hijack, then sends a transferFrom() call to the safe contract with specific parameters.
Detailed characteristics: Allows an attacker to hijack any ERC721 or ERC1155 tokens rented by manipulating the fallback handler address.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function setFallbackHandler(address handler) external;
```
