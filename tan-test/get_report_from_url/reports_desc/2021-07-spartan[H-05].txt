Type of vulnerability: AMM price oracle manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: Synthrealise function calculates baseValueLP and baseValueSynth based on AMM spot price, making it vulnerable to flash loan attacks.
Execution process: An attacker can manipulate the AMM pool ratio by repeatedly calling the realise function, affecting the LP token value.
Detailed characteristics: The vulnerable code is located in Synth.sol at lines 187-199, where the formula for calculating LP token value is considered dangerous.
Vulnerable code:
```
function realise(address token_pool) public {
    // vulnerable code for calculating LP token value
    ...
}
```
