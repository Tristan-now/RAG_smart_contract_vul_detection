Type of vulnerability: Sandwich attack
Cause of vulnerability: Permissionless function `distributeMochi` in `FeePoolV0.sol` allows anyone to trigger it, enabling an attacker to launch a sandwich attack with a flash loan to steal funds.
Execution process: An attacker can exploit the permissionless function to execute a flash loan sandwich attack, potentially stealing all funds in the pool.
Detailed characteristics: Lack of permission control on the `distributeMochi` function allows for unauthorized access and manipulation of funds, making it vulnerable to sandwich attacks.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function distributeMochi() public {
    // code logic for distributing Mochi tokens
}
```
