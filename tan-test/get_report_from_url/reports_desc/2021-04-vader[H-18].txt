Type of vulnerability: AMM price oracle manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: The deposit function increases the member's weight based on the swap output amount when trading the deposited underlying synth amount, allowing for manipulation.
Execution process: Attacker creates custom tokens, adds liquidity to create an expensive price for the token, deposits fake synth with high weight, then calls harvest with a valuable "real" synth to earn almost all vault rewards.
Detailed characteristics: Rewards are distributed based on member weight, which can be inflated with valueless custom tokens. The calcReward function disregards the synth parameter, making it easy for attackers to manipulate rewards.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
_weight = iUTILS(UTILS()).calcValueInBase(iSYNTH(_synth).TOKEN(), _amount);
```
