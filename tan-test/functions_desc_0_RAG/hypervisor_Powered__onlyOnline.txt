This code snippet defines a private function named `_onlyOnline` that includes a view modifier. The function checks whether the contract is online by calling the `isOnline()` function and requires that the contract is indeed online. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- None

Code Breakdown:
- The `_onlyOnline` function is marked as private, meaning it can only be accessed within the contract or its derived contracts.
- The function includes a view modifier, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract and can be called without consuming gas.
- Within the function, a `require` statement is used to check if the contract is online by calling the `isOnline()` function.
- If the `isOnline()` function returns false, the `require` statement will revert the transaction with the error message "Powered: is not online".

Summary:
The `_onlyOnline` function ensures that the contract is online before allowing any further actions to be taken. It provides a security measure to prevent certain functions from being executed when the contract is not in the expected state.
