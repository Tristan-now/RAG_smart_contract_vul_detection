This code defines a public view function named `getCurrentBlockDifficulty`, which retrieves the current block's difficulty level. The function does not accept any parameters and returns a `uint256` value representing the difficulty of the current block.

Explanation:
- The function signature includes the visibility specifier `public`, indicating that the function can be called externally.
- The function does not have any parameters, as it directly accesses the current block's difficulty level.
- Within the function, the block variable `block.difficulty` is used to retrieve the difficulty level of the current block.
- The retrieved difficulty value is assigned to the variable `difficulty`.
- Finally, the function returns the `difficulty` value to the caller.

Summary:
The `getCurrentBlockDifficulty` function provides a way to access the difficulty level of the current block. It is a read-only function that allows external entities to query the blockchain for this specific block property.
