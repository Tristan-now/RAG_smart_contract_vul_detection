Parameters:
None

Return Value:
None

Code Breakdown:
The function `claimRewardTreasury` is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function does not accept any parameters. Inside the function, there is a `require` statement that checks if the `msg.sender` (the address of the caller) is equal to the `YetiFinanceTreasury` address. If the condition is not met, the function will revert, and the transaction will not be executed.

Vulnerability prediction:
This function may be vulnerable to unauthorized access if the `YetiFinanceTreasury` address is not properly secured or if there are any vulnerabilities in the contract that could allow an attacker to manipulate the `msg.sender` address.

Summary:
The `claimRewardTreasury` function restricts access to claiming rewards from the Yeti Finance Treasury contract to only the specified `YetiFinanceTreasury` address. This ensures that only authorized entities can interact with the function and claim rewards from the treasury.
