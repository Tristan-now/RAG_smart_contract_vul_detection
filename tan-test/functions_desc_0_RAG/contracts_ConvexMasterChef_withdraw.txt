This code defines a public function named `withdraw` that allows users to withdraw a specified amount of tokens from a pool. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_pid`: An unsigned integer representing the pool ID from which the user wants to withdraw tokens.
2. `_amount`: An unsigned integer representing the amount of tokens the user wants to withdraw.

Code Breakdown:
1. The function starts by accessing the `PoolInfo` and `UserInfo` storage variables for the specified pool ID `_pid` and the message sender (`msg.sender`).
2. It checks if the user has enough tokens (`user.amount`) to withdraw the specified `_amount`. If not, it reverts with an error message.
3. The function then calls the `updatePool` function to update the pool information before calculating the pending rewards for the user.
4. The pending rewards are calculated based on the user's current amount of tokens, the accumulated Convex token per share in the pool (`pool.accCvxPerShare`), and the user's `rewardDebt`.
5. The `safeRewardTransfer` function is called to transfer the pending rewards to the user.
6. The user's token amount is reduced by the `_amount` withdrawn, and the user's `rewardDebt` is updated accordingly.
7. The withdrawn tokens (`_amount`) are transferred from the pool's LP token contract to the user's address (`msg.sender`).
8. If the pool has a rewarder contract assigned (`_rewarder`), the `onReward` function of the rewarder is called to handle any extra rewards for the user.
9. Event emitters are used to log the reward payment and withdrawal actions.

Summary:
The `withdraw` function allows users to withdraw tokens from a pool, updating their reward status and transferring the tokens accordingly. It also handles any extra rewards provided by a rewarder contract associated with the pool.
