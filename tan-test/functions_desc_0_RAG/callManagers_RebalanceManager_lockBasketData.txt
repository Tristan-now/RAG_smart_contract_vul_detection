This code defines an internal function named `lockBasketData`, which is responsible for locking the basket data by making a single call to the `basket` contract. The function accepts a single parameter `_block`, which is a `uint256` value representing the block number to set as the lock.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_block`: A `uint256` value representing the block number to set as the lock for the basket data.

Code Breakdown:
The `lockBasketData` function takes an input parameter `_block` of type `uint256`. Inside the function, a single call is made to the `basket` contract using the `singleCall` function. The parameters for this call include:
- `address(basket)`: The address of the `basket` contract.
- `abi.encodeWithSelector(basket.setLock.selector, _block)`: This encodes the function selector `setLock` of the `basket` contract along with the `_block` parameter to be passed to the function.
- `0`: The value of ether to be sent along with the function call (in this case, no ether is sent).

Summary:
The `lockBasketData` function is used to set a lock on the basket data by making a single call to the `basket` contract with the specified block number. This function helps in securing the basket data by preventing any modifications or updates beyond the specified block number.
