This code defines an external function named `setAccountDepositCap`, which allows the owner of the contract to set a new value for the account deposit cap. The function takes a single parameter `_newAccountDepositCap` of type `uint256`, representing the new account deposit cap value.

Parameters:
1. `_newAccountDepositCap`: A `uint256` value that represents the new account deposit cap to be set by the owner.

Function Modifier:
- `onlyOwner`: This modifier restricts the execution of the function to only the owner of the contract, ensuring that only the authorized entity can change the account deposit cap.

Function Execution:
- The function first assigns the value of `_newAccountDepositCap` to the `_accountDepositCap` state variable, updating the account deposit cap.
- It then emits an `AccountDepositCapChanged` event, providing the new account deposit cap value as the emitted data.

Summary:
The `setAccountDepositCap` function allows the contract owner to update the account deposit cap value. By using the `onlyOwner` modifier, the function ensures that only the owner can modify this critical parameter, maintaining control over the deposit cap setting.
