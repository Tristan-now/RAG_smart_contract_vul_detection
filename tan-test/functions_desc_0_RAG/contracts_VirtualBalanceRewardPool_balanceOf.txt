This code defines a public view function named `balanceOf` that takes an `address` parameter `account` and returns a `uint256` value representing the balance of the specified account in the `deposits` contract.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account`: An address parameter representing the account for which the balance needs to be retrieved.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the balance of the specified `account`.

Code Breakdown:
The `balanceOf` function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract. It takes an `address` parameter `account` representing the account for which the balance needs to be retrieved. Inside the function, it calls the `balanceOf` function on the `deposits` contract, passing the `account` parameter. The `balanceOf` function in the `deposits` contract is assumed to return the balance of the specified account.

Summary:
The `balanceOf` function provides a convenient way to retrieve the balance of a specific account in the `deposits` contract. It abstracts the logic of retrieving the balance and encapsulates it within a single function call for ease of use.
