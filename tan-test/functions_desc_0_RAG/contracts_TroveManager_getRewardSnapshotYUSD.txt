This code defines a function named `getRewardSnapshotYUSD` that is external and view, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the contract. The function takes two parameters: `_borrower`, which is an address representing the borrower, and `_token`, which is also an address representing a token.

The function returns a `uint` value, which is the YUSD debt of the specified token for the given borrower stored in the `rewardSnapshots` mapping.

In summary, this function allows external callers to retrieve the YUSD debt of a specific token for a particular borrower from the `rewardSnapshots` mapping.
