This code defines a public function named `setVotingDelay` that allows the governance entity to update the voting delay parameter. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `newVotingDelay`: A `uint256` value representing the new voting delay that the governance entity wants to set.

Function Modifier:
- `onlyGovernance`: This modifier restricts the access to the function to only the governance entity, ensuring that only authorized users can update the voting delay.

Function Logic:
- Inside the function, the current value of the `_votingDelay` parameter is stored in the `oldVotingDelay` variable to track the previous value.
- The `_votingDelay` parameter is then updated with the new value provided as `newVotingDelay`.
- An event `VotingDelayUpdated` is emitted, capturing the old and new voting delay values for transparency and tracking purposes.

Summary:
The `setVotingDelay` function allows the governance entity to modify the voting delay parameter. It ensures that only authorized users can make this change by using the `onlyGovernance` modifier. The function updates the `_votingDelay` parameter with the new value and emits an event to log the change.

[REFERENCE VULNERABILITY REPORTS]
- No specific vulnerability reports are referenced in this explanation.

[TASK CODE]
```solidity
function setVotingDelay(uint256 newVotingDelay) public onlyGovernance {
    uint256 oldVotingDelay = _votingDelay;
    _votingDelay = newVotingDelay;
    emit VotingDelayUpdated(oldVotingDelay, newVotingDelay);
}
```
