This code snippet defines an external function named `setURI` that allows the contract owner to update the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) associated with the contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_newURI`: A string parameter representing the new URI that the contract owner wants to set.

Functionality:
The `setURI` function is marked as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function takes a single parameter `_newURI`, which is the new URI that the contract owner wants to set. Within the function, the current URI `_uri` is updated to the value of `_newURI`.

Access Control:
The function includes a modifier `onlyOwner`, which implies that only the owner of the contract can call this function. This access control mechanism ensures that only authorized parties can modify the URI associated with the contract.

Summary:
The `setURI` function provides a way for the contract owner to update the URI of the contract. By passing a new URI as a parameter to this function, the owner can change the reference to external resources associated with the contract.
