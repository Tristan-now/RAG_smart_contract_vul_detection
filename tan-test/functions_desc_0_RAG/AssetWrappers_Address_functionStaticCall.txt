This code defines an internal view function named `functionStaticCall`, which is used to perform a static call to a target address. The function accepts three parameters: the target address (`target`), the data to be passed in the call (`data`), and an error message (`errorMessage`). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `target`: The address of the contract to which the static call will be made.
2. `data`: The data to be passed in the static call.
3. `errorMessage`: An error message to be displayed if the static call fails.

Return Value:
The function returns a `bytes` value representing the result of the static call.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `target`, `data`, and `errorMessage`. `functionStaticCall` is an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state of the contract. The function first checks if the target address is a contract by calling the `isContract` function. If the target address is not a contract, it reverts with an error message indicating that it is a static call to a non-contract address.

Next, the function uses the `staticcall` function to perform a static call to the target address with the provided data. The result of the static call is stored in the variables `success` and `returndata`.

The function then calls the `verifyCallResult` function to verify the result of the static call. This function checks if the call was successful and reverts with the provided error message if it was not successful.

Finally, the function returns the result of the static call (`returndata`) after verifying the call result.

Vulnerability prediction:
This function may be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack if the static call is followed by state changes that could be manipulated by an external contract.

Summary:
The `functionStaticCall` function is used to perform a static call to a target contract address with the provided data. It ensures that the target address is a contract, performs the static call, verifies the result, and returns the result of the static call.
