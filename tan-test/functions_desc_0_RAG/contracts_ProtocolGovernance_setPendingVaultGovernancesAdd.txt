This code defines an external function named `setPendingVaultGovernancesAdd`, which allows an admin to set pending addresses for vault governance addition. The function accepts an array of addresses (`addresses`) as a parameter and is restricted to be called only by an admin.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `addresses`: An array of addresses that represent the pending addresses for vault governance addition.

Functionality:
- The function first checks if the caller of the function is an admin by calling the `isAdmin` function with `msg.sender` as the parameter. If the caller is not an admin, it will revert with the error message "ADMIN".
- If the caller is an admin, the function sets the `_pendingVaultGovernancesAdd` variable to the provided `addresses` array.
- It also sets the `pendingVaultGovernancesAddTimestamp` variable to the current block timestamp plus the governance delay specified in the `params` variable.

Summary:
The `setPendingVaultGovernancesAdd` function allows an admin to set pending addresses for vault governance addition. It ensures that only admins can call this function and updates the pending addresses and timestamp accordingly.
