This code defines an internal view function named `baseData` that returns a reference to a `PoolStorage.Base` struct. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
None

Return Value:
`ps`: The function returns a reference to a `PoolStorage.Base` struct.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `internal` and `view` modifiers, indicating that it is an internal view function that does not modify the state of the contract. Within the function, a reference to a `PoolStorage.Base` struct named `ps` is declared and initialized by calling the `PoolStorage.ps` function with the parameter `bps()`. The `bps()` function is assumed to return a value that is used to retrieve the `PoolStorage.Base` struct.

Next, a `require` statement is used to ensure that the `ps.govPool` address stored in the `PoolStorage.Base` struct is not equal to `address(0)`. If the condition is not met (i.e., `ps.govPool` is equal to `address(0)`), the function will revert with the error message 'INVALID_TOKEN'.

Overall, the `baseData` function is responsible for retrieving and validating the `PoolStorage.Base` struct, ensuring that the `govPool` address is valid before proceeding with any further operations.
