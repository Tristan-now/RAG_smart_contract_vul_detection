This code defines an external function named `removePool` that allows the contract owner to remove a pool associated with a specific token. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_token`: The address of the token for which the pool needs to be removed.

Functionality:
The `removePool` function takes the `_token` address as a parameter and updates the `pools` mapping for that token to set the pool address to `address(0)` and the pool balance to 0. This effectively removes the pool associated with the specified token from the contract's state.

Access Control:
The function is restricted to be called only by the contract owner (`onlyOwner` modifier), ensuring that only the owner can remove pools.

Event Emission:
After removing the pool, the function emits a `PoolRemoved` event with the `_token` address to notify external entities about the removal of the pool.

Overall, the `removePool` function provides a way for the contract owner to remove pools associated with specific tokens, maintaining the integrity and management of pools within the contract.
