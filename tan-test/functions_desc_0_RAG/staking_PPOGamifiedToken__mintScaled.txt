This code snippet defines a private function named `_mintScaled` that is responsible for minting a specified amount of tokens to a given account. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_account`: The address of the account to which the tokens will be minted.
2. `_amount`: The amount of tokens to be minted.

Code Breakdown:
- The function emits a `Transfer` event indicating the minting of tokens from the zero address to the `_account` address with the specified `_amount`.
- It then calls the `_afterTokenTransfer` function, passing the zero address, `_account`, and `_amount` as parameters. This function likely contains additional logic related to token transfers or minting operations.

Summary:
The `_mintScaled` function facilitates the minting of a specified amount of tokens to a designated account. It emits a transfer event to reflect the minting action and may perform further operations related to token transfers or minting.
