This code defines an internal function named `_addLiquidity721WETH`, which is responsible for adding liquidity to a specific NFTX vault using ERC721 tokens and WETH (Wrapped Ether). The function accepts several parameters and performs a series of actions to facilitate the liquidity addition process. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `vaultId`: An unsigned integer representing the ID of the NFTX vault where liquidity will be added.
2. `ids`: An array of unsigned integers containing the IDs of the ERC721 tokens to be used for liquidity addition.
3. `minWethIn`: An unsigned integer specifying the minimum amount of WETH to be provided for liquidity.
4. `wethIn`: An unsigned integer representing the actual amount of WETH provided for liquidity.
5. `to`: The address where the resulting liquidity tokens will be sent.

Return Values:
The function returns three unsigned integers representing the total liquidity tokens minted, the resulting liquidity token balance, and the amount of WETH locked in the process.

Code Breakdown:
1. The function first retrieves the address of the NFTX vault associated with the provided `vaultId` and ensures that the vault exists.
2. It then iterates over the provided `ids` array, transferring the corresponding ERC721 tokens to the zap contract and approving their usage by the vault.
3. The function mints new NFTX tokens by calling the `mint` function of the NFTX vault with the provided `ids`.
4. It calculates the expected balance of the NFTX tokens received after minting and verifies that the actual balance matches the expected balance.
5. Finally, the function calls the `_addLiquidityAndLock` function to add liquidity to the vault, lock the provided WETH, and return the resulting values.

Vulnerability Prediction:
Given the complexity of the function and the interactions with external contracts, potential vulnerabilities could arise from improper handling of token transfers, approvals, or balance calculations. It is crucial to ensure that all token operations are executed securely to prevent any loss of funds or unexpected behavior.

Summary:
The `_addLiquidity721WETH` function facilitates the addition of liquidity to an NFTX vault using ERC721 tokens. It handles the transfer and approval of tokens, mints new NFTX tokens, verifies the resulting balance, and adds liquidity to the vault while locking the provided WETH.
