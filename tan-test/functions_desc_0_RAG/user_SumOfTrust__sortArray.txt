This code defines a private function named `_sortArray` that sorts an array of `LockedInfo` structs based on the `vouchingAmount` field in ascending or descending order. The function accepts an array of `LockedInfo` structs (`arr`) and a boolean flag (`isPositive`) indicating whether to sort in ascending or descending order. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `arr`: An array of `LockedInfo` structs that need to be sorted.
2. `isPositive`: A boolean flag that determines the sorting order. If `true`, the array will be sorted in ascending order; if `false`, the array will be sorted in descending order.

Return Value:
The function returns the sorted array of `LockedInfo` structs.

Code Breakdown:
The function starts by getting the length of the input array `arr` and stores it in the `length` variable. It then uses nested `for` loops to compare each element of the array with every other element for sorting. The outer loop iterates over each element of the array starting from index 0 up to `length - 1`. The inner loop iterates over the remaining elements starting from the next index after the outer loop index up to the last element of the array. Within the inner loop, it checks the value of `isPositive` to determine whether to sort in ascending or descending order. If `isPositive` is `true`, it compares the `vouchingAmount` of the current element (`arr[i]`) with the `vouchingAmount` of the next element (`arr[j]`). If the current element's `vouchingAmount` is less than the next element's `vouchingAmount`, it swaps the elements to sort them in ascending order. If `isPositive` is `false`, it performs the comparison in reverse order to sort the elements in descending order. After sorting the array, the function returns the sorted array of `LockedInfo` structs.

Vulnerability Prediction:
This function may be vulnerable to a time complexity issue due to its nested loop structure, which can lead to inefficiency when sorting large arrays. It is essential to consider the performance implications of sorting algorithms when dealing with significant amounts of data.

Summary:
The `_sortArray` function sorts an array of `LockedInfo` structs based on the `vouchingAmount` field in either ascending or descending order, depending on the value of the `isPositive` flag. The function uses nested loops to compare and swap elements, ultimately returning the sorted array.
