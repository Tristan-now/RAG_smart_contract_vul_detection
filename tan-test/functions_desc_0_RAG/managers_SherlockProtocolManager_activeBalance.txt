This code snippet defines an external view function named `activeBalance` that returns the active balance of a protocol identified by the `_protocol` parameter. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_protocol`: A bytes32 parameter representing the protocol for which the active balance needs to be retrieved.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the active balance of the specified protocol.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `activeBalance` function name, the `_protocol` parameter of type bytes32, the external visibility specifier (meaning it can be called from outside the contract), the view modifier (indicating that the function does not modify the state), and the override keyword (indicating that this function overrides a function from a parent contract). Additionally, there is a modifier `protocolExists(_protocol)` which ensures that the specified protocol exists before proceeding with the function execution.

Inside the function, it simply calls another internal function `_activeBalance(_protocol)` to retrieve the active balance of the specified protocol. The `_activeBalance` function is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract or its inherited contracts.

Overall, this function provides a read-only view of the active balance of a specific protocol without modifying the contract state.

Vulnerability Prediction:
Since this function is a simple read-only function that retrieves data without modifying the state, there are no apparent vulnerabilities associated with it based on the provided code snippet.

Summary:
The `activeBalance` function allows external callers to query and retrieve the active balance of a protocol identified by the `_protocol` parameter. It ensures that the specified protocol exists before returning the active balance value.
