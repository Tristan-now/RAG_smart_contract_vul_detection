This code defines an internal function named `safeTransferETH`, which is responsible for transferring a specified amount of Ether to a recipient address safely. The function accepts two parameters: the recipient address (`recipient`) and the amount of Ether to transfer (`amount`). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `recipient`: The address to which the Ether will be transferred.
2. `amount`: The amount of Ether to transfer to the recipient.

Code Breakdown:
The `safeTransferETH` function is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. It accepts two parameters: `recipient` (the address to transfer Ether to) and `amount` (the amount of Ether to transfer). Inside the function, a low-level call is made to the `recipient` address with the specified `amount` of Ether. The call is wrapped in a tuple assignment to capture the success status of the call. The `recipient.call{value: amount}("")` syntax is used to transfer Ether to the `recipient` address. The function then checks the success status of the call using the `success` variable. If the transfer is successful (`success` is true), the function continues execution. If the transfer fails (`success` is false), the function reverts with an error message "ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED" using the `require` statement.

Summary:
The `safeTransferETH` function facilitates the secure transfer of Ether to a specified recipient address. It uses a low-level call to transfer Ether and checks the success status of the transfer. If the transfer fails, the function reverts with an error message to ensure the safety of the transaction.
