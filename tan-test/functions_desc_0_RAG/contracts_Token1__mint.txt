This code defines an internal function named `_mint`, which is responsible for minting new tokens and adding them to a specified account. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account`: The address to which the newly minted tokens will be credited.
2. `amount`: The number of tokens to be minted and added to the `account`.

Code Breakdown:
The `_mint` function is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. It takes two parameters: `account`, which represents the recipient address for the minted tokens, and `amount`, which specifies the quantity of tokens to be minted. 

Within the function, a `require` statement is used to ensure that the `account` address is not the zero address, as minting tokens to the zero address is typically not allowed in most token contracts. If the `account` is the zero address, the function will revert with an error message indicating "recipient".

The total token supply is then increased by the `amount` of tokens being minted using the `totalSupply += amount` statement. This operation effectively mints new tokens and adds them to the total token supply.

Next, the balance of the `account` address is incremented by the `amount` of tokens using the `_balances[account] += amount` statement. This step updates the token balance of the specified account to reflect the newly minted tokens.

Finally, an `emit` statement is used to trigger a `Transfer` event, indicating the minting of tokens from the zero address to the specified `account` address with the specified `amount` of tokens.

In summary, the `_mint` function mints a specified `amount` of tokens and adds them to the `account` address, updating both the total token supply and the balance of the recipient account accordingly.
