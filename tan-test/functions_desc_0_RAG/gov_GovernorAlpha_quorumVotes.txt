This code defines a public view function named `quorumVotes`, which calculates the minimum number of votes required for a quorum at a specific block number. The function accepts a single parameter `blockNumber` of type `uint` representing the block number for which the quorum votes are calculated.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `blockNumber`: A `uint` value representing the block number for which the quorum votes are calculated.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint` value representing the minimum number of votes required for a quorum at the specified block number.

Code Breakdown:
The `quorumVotes` function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract state. The function calculates the quorum votes by dividing the total supply of the `xole` token at the specified `blockNumber` by 25. The `totalSupplyAt` function is assumed to be a part of the `xole` token contract and returns the total supply of the token at a specific block number. The result of this division operation is the minimum number of votes required for a quorum at the given block number.

Vulnerability Prediction:
This function is a simple calculation function and does not appear to have any specific vulnerabilities based on the provided code snippet.

Summary:
The `quorumVotes` function calculates the minimum number of votes required for a quorum at a specific block number by dividing the total supply of the `xole` token at that block number by 25.
