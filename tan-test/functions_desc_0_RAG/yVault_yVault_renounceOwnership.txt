This code snippet defines a function named `renounceOwnership` that is a public view function and overrides a function from a parent contract with the `onlyOwner` modifier. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- This function does not return any value as it is marked as a view function.

Code Breakdown:
- The function `renounceOwnership` is a public function, meaning it can be called externally.
- The function is marked as a view function, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract.
- The function overrides a function from a parent contract that enforces the `onlyOwner` modifier, which restricts access to the function to only the owner of the contract.
- Inside the function, a `revert` statement is used with the message "Cannot renounce ownership". This means that if anyone tries to call this function, it will always revert with this specific error message.

Vulnerability prediction:
- This function is not vulnerable to any specific attack as it simply reverts with a predefined message when called. It does not perform any state changes or sensitive operations that could lead to vulnerabilities.

Summary:
- The `renounceOwnership` function is a simple function that prevents the renouncement of ownership by reverting with a specific error message. It is designed to ensure that ownership cannot be renounced in the contract.

[REFERENCE VULNERABILITY REPORTS]
- No specific vulnerability reports are relevant to this function.
