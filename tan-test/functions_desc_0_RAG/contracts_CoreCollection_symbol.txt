This code snippet defines a public view function named `symbol` that overrides a function from an inherited contract. The function returns a string representing the symbol of the token.

Explanation:

- The function signature indicates that it is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract's state.
- The `override` keyword is used to explicitly indicate that this function is overriding a function from a parent contract.
- The function returns a `string memory` type, which is a dynamically-sized byte array that resides in memory.
- Inside the function body, it simply returns the value of the `_symbol` variable.

Overall, this function provides a read-only view of the token symbol stored in the `_symbol` variable.
