This code defines an internal function named `_getDefaultTradeInfo`, which is used to retrieve trade information for a given SetToken and component token. The function accepts three parameters: an `ISetToken` instance `_setToken`, an `IERC20` instance `_component`, and a boolean `calculateTradeDirection`. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_setToken`: An instance of the `ISetToken` interface representing the SetToken for which trade information is being retrieved.
2. `_component`: An instance of the `IERC20` interface representing the component token for which trade information is being retrieved.
3. `calculateTradeDirection`: A boolean flag indicating whether to calculate the trade direction.

Return Value:
`tradeInfo`: A struct of type `TradeInfo` containing various trade-related information.

Code Breakdown:
The function initializes a `TradeInfo` struct variable named `tradeInfo` to store the trade information. It sets the `setToken` field of `tradeInfo` to the provided `_setToken` instance and retrieves the total supply of the SetToken using `_setToken.totalSupply()`, storing it in `setTotalSupply`. It then calls the internal `_getExchangeAdapter` function to determine the exchange adapter for the given SetToken and component token, and retrieves the exchange data from the `executionInfo` mapping.

If `calculateTradeDirection` is true, the function calls the `_calculateTradeSizeAndDirection` function to determine the trade direction and size based on the SetToken, component token, and total supply. The results are stored in the `isSendTokenFixed` and `totalFixedQuantity` fields of `tradeInfo`.

Based on the calculated trade direction, the function determines the `sendToken` and `receiveToken` addresses. If `isSendTokenFixed` is true, the component token is set as the `sendToken` and WETH (wrapped Ether) is set as the `receiveToken`. Otherwise, WETH is set as the `sendToken` and the component token is set as the `receiveToken`.

Finally, the function retrieves the pre-trade balances of the `sendToken` and `receiveToken` within the SetToken contract and stores them in the `preTradeSendTokenBalance` and `preTradeReceiveTokenBalance` fields of `tradeInfo`.

This function is used to gather essential trade information before executing a trade involving a SetToken and a component token.
