This code snippet defines an internal function named `_getTokenType` that takes a string parameter `symbol` and returns a value of type `TokenType`. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `symbol`: A string representing the symbol of a token for which the token type needs to be determined.

Return Value:
The function returns a value of type `TokenType`, which is obtained by converting the value stored at the key corresponding to the symbol in the contract's storage to a `TokenType`.

Code Breakdown:
The function `_getTokenType` is defined as an internal function, meaning it can only be accessed within the contract or its derived contracts. It takes a `string` parameter `symbol`, which represents the symbol of a token. Inside the function, `_getTokenTypeKey(symbol)` is called to obtain the key associated with the symbol in the contract's storage. This key is used to retrieve a value from the contract's storage using the `getUint` function. The retrieved value is then converted to a `TokenType` enum using a typecast, and this enum value is returned as the result of the function.

Vulnerability Prediction:
This function may be vulnerable to a potential attack related to storage manipulation if proper access control mechanisms are not in place to protect the storage key associated with the token symbol.

Summary:
The `_getTokenType` function is an internal function that determines the token type based on the symbol provided as input. It retrieves the corresponding key from the contract's storage, fetches the value associated with that key using `getUint`, and converts it to a `TokenType` enum before returning it as the output of the function.
