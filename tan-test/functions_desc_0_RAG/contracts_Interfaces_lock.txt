This code snippet defines an interface named `IExtraRewardsDistributor` that includes the following functions:

1. `addReward(address _token, uint256 _amount) external;`: This function allows adding rewards for a specific token. It takes two parameters: `_token`, which is the address of the token for which rewards are being added, and `_amount`, which is the amount of rewards being added.

The purpose of this interface is to provide a standardized way for contracts to interact with an external rewards distributor contract. By implementing this interface, a contract can ensure that it has the necessary functions to interact with the rewards distributor contract.

The functions defined in this interface allow for adding rewards, queuing new rewards, notifying reward amounts, and getting rewards for a specific account. The `IExtraRewardsDistributor` interface acts as a blueprint for contracts that want to distribute extra rewards to users based on certain conditions or events.
