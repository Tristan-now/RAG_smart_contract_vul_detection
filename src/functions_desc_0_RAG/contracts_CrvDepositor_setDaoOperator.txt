This code snippet defines an external function named `setDaoOperator` that allows changing the `daoOperator` address. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_daoOperator`: The new address to set as the `daoOperator`.

Functionality:
- The function `setDaoOperator` is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- It takes one parameter `_daoOperator`, which is the new address to set as the `daoOperator`.
- The function includes a `require` statement to check if the `msg.sender` (the caller of the function) is equal to the current `daoOperator`. If not, the function will revert with the error message `!auth`.
- If the `require` condition is met, the `daoOperator` address is updated to the new address `_daoOperator`.

Summary:
The `setDaoOperator` function allows only the current `daoOperator` to change the `daoOperator` address to a new address provided as a parameter. This function ensures that only authorized entities can modify the `daoOperator` address, adding a layer of security to the contract.
