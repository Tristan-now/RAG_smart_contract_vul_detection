This code defines an internal function named `_processRentCollection`, which handles the collection of rent for a specific card owned by a user. The function takes three parameters: `_user` (address of the user), `_card` (the ID of the card), and `_timeOfCollection` (the timestamp when the rent is collected). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_user`: Address of the user who owns the card.
2. `_card`: ID of the card for which rent is being collected.
3. `_timeOfCollection`: Timestamp indicating when the rent is being collected.

Code Breakdown:
1. Calculate the rent owed for the card based on the card price and the time elapsed since the last collection. The rent owed is calculated as `(cardPrice[_card] * (_timeOfCollection - timeLastCollected[_card])) / 1 days`.
2. Pay the calculated rent to the treasury using the `treasury.payRent(_rentOwed)` function.
3. Calculate the time held to increment by subtracting the last collection time from the current collection time.
4. If the user has a time limit for holding the card, adjust it accordingly by reducing the time held limit and updating the card's time limit.
5. Update the time held for the card by the user and the total time held for the card.
6. Update the rent collected statistics for the user, card, and user-card combination.
7. Update the total rent collected by adding the rent owed.
8. Update the last collection time for the card to the current collection time.
9. Track the longest owner of the card based on the time held by each user.
10. Emit a `LogRentCollection` event with details of the rent collected, time held by the user, card ID, and user address.

Overall, the `_processRentCollection` function manages the rent collection process for a specific card, updating various statistics and tracking the longest owner of the card based on the time held.
