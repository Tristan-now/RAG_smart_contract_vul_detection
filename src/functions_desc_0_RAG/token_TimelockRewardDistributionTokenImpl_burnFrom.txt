This code snippet defines a public function named `burnFrom` that allows the owner of the contract to burn a specified amount of tokens from a specific account. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account`: The address of the account from which tokens will be burned.
2. `amount`: The amount of tokens to be burned from the specified account.

Functionality:
The `burnFrom` function is a public function that can be called by the owner of the contract. It takes two parameters: `account`, which is the address of the account from which tokens will be burned, and `amount`, which specifies the number of tokens to be burned.

Within the function, the `_burn` function is called with the `account` and `amount` parameters. This `_burn` function is assumed to handle the actual burning of tokens from the specified account. The burning process typically involves reducing the token balance of the specified account by the specified amount.

It's important to note that the `onlyOwner` modifier is applied to the `burnFrom` function, which means that only the owner of the contract can call this function. This restriction ensures that only authorized parties can initiate the burning of tokens from a specific account.

Overall, the `burnFrom` function provides a controlled way for the contract owner to burn tokens from a designated account, which can be useful for various purposes such as token management, reducing token supply, or implementing token burning mechanisms.
