This code defines an external view function named `balanceOf`, which retrieves the balance of a specific account. The function accepts one parameter:

Parameter:
1. `account`: The address of the account for which the balance needs to be retrieved.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the balance of the specified account.

Code Explanation:
The `balanceOf` function is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the contract state. The function takes an `address` parameter named `account`, which represents the account for which the balance is to be retrieved. Inside the function, it accesses the `_balances` mapping using the `account` parameter as the key and returns the corresponding balance value stored in the mapping.

Overall, this function provides a way to query the balance of a specific account stored in the `_balances` mapping within the smart contract.
