This code snippet defines an external function named `setExposure` that allows the contract owner to set a new exposure address. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_exposure`: The address of the new exposure contract that the owner wants to set.

Functionality:
- The function `setExposure` is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- The function checks if the provided `_exposure` address is not a zero address. If a zero address is provided, the function will revert with the error message "Zero address provided."
- If the provided address is valid, the function sets the `exposure` variable to the new exposure contract address (`IExposure(_exposure)`).
- Finally, the function emits a `LogNewExposure` event to log the address of the new exposure contract that was set.

Overall, this function allows the contract owner to update the exposure contract address, ensuring that the new address is valid and emitting an event to track the change.
