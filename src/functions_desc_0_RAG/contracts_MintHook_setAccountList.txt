This code snippet defines a public function named `setAccountList` that overrides a function from a parent contract and restricts access to only the owner of the contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `accountList`: An interface type variable representing an instance of the `IAccountList` contract.

Functionality:
The `setAccountList` function is a public function that allows the owner of the contract to set the `accountList` by passing an instance of the `IAccountList` contract. The function overrides a function from a parent contract, indicating that the parent contract has a function with the same name and parameters that this function is replacing.

Access Restriction:
The `onlyOwner` modifier is applied to the function, ensuring that only the owner of the contract can call this function. This access control mechanism restricts the ability to set the `accountList` to the contract owner, providing a level of security and control over this operation.

Inheritance:
The `super.setAccountList(accountList)` statement within the function indicates that the function is calling the `setAccountList` function from the parent contract. By using `super`, the function is explicitly invoking the parent contract's implementation of `setAccountList`, allowing for additional logic to be executed before or after setting the `accountList`.

Overall, this code snippet demonstrates a controlled way for the contract owner to set the `accountList` by leveraging inheritance and access control through the `onlyOwner` modifier.
