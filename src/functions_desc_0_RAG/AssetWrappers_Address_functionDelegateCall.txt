This code defines an internal function named `functionDelegateCall`, which is responsible for making a delegate call to a target contract. The function accepts three parameters: the address of the target contract (`target`), the data to be passed in the delegate call (`data`), and an error message string (`errorMessage`). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `target`: The address of the target contract to which the delegate call will be made.
2. `data`: The data to be passed in the delegate call.
3. `errorMessage`: A string message to be used in case of an error.

Return Value:
The function returns a `bytes` memory variable containing the result of the delegate call.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `target`, `data`, and `errorMessage`. `functionDelegateCall` is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function first checks if the `target` address is a contract by calling the `isContract` function. If the `target` is not a contract, it reverts with an error message indicating that the delegate call is being made to a non-contract address.

If the `target` is a contract, the function proceeds to make a delegate call using the `delegatecall` function. The result of the delegate call is stored in a tuple containing a boolean `success` indicating whether the call was successful and `returndata` containing the returned data from the call.

The function then calls another internal function `verifyCallResult` with the `success`, `returndata`, and `errorMessage` parameters to handle the verification of the delegate call result and return the appropriate data.

Vulnerability prediction:
This function may be vulnerable to a delegate call attack if the delegate call is not handled properly or if the target contract is malicious. Delegate calls can be risky as they execute code in the context of the calling contract, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

Summary:
The `functionDelegateCall` function facilitates making a delegate call to a target contract by verifying that the target is a contract, performing the delegate call, and handling the result. Proper handling and verification of delegate calls are crucial to prevent potential vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.
