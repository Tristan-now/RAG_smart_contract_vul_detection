This code defines a function named `getUnactivatedStakersPoolBalance` that is part of a contract implementing an interface with a function to return the balance of a staking pool for unactivated stakers. The function accepts an `IERC20` token interface as a parameter and returns a `uint256` value representing the stake balance of the staking pool.

Parameters:
1. `_token`: An interface representing the ERC20 token used for staking.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the stake balance of the staking pool for unactivated stakers.

Code Explanation:
The `getUnactivatedStakersPoolBalance` function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract's state. The function simply returns the `stakeBalance` property from the `baseData()` function. This property likely stores the total balance of the staking pool for unactivated stakers.

Vulnerability Prediction:
Since this function is a simple view function that only reads data from the contract, there are no apparent vulnerabilities in the provided code snippet.

Summary:
The `getUnactivatedStakersPoolBalance` function retrieves and returns the stake balance of the staking pool for unactivated stakers using the `baseData().stakeBalance` property.
