This code snippet defines an external function named `payoutClaim`, which is part of an interface that the contract must implement. The function takes two parameters: `_receiver`, which is the address of the recipient of the payout, and `_amount`, which is the amount of tokens to be paid out.

Parameters:
1. `_receiver`: The address of the recipient who will receive the payout.
2. `_amount`: The amount of tokens to be paid out to the `_receiver`.

Functionality:
The `payoutClaim` function is designed to facilitate the payout of a specified amount of tokens to a designated recipient. As an external function, it can be called from outside the contract by other contracts or externally owned accounts.

Since the function body is not provided in the code snippet, the actual implementation of how the payout is processed and the tokens are transferred to the `_receiver` address would need to be defined within the contract that implements this interface.

Overall, the `payoutClaim` function serves as a placeholder in the interface, outlining the required function signature that any implementing contract must adhere to in order to fulfill the functionality of paying out tokens to a specified recipient.
