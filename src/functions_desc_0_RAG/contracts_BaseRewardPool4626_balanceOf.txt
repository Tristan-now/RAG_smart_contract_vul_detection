This code defines a function named `balanceOf` that overrides the `view` function from the `BaseRewardPool` contract and the `IERC20` interface. The function takes an `address` parameter named `account` and returns a `uint256` value representing the balance of the specified account.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account`: The address for which the balance needs to be retrieved.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the balance of the specified account.

Code Breakdown:
The `balanceOf` function simply delegates the balance retrieval to the `BaseRewardPool` contract by calling its `balanceOf` function with the provided `account` address. Since the `balanceOf` function is being overridden, the implementation in the `BaseRewardPool` contract will be used to determine the balance of the specified account.

Summary:
The `balanceOf` function provides a convenient way to retrieve the balance of a specific account by delegating the balance retrieval to the `BaseRewardPool` contract. This function is part of the ERC20 interface implementation and allows external parties to query the balance of any address in the reward pool.
