This code snippet defines a function named `setGlobalRateLimitedMinter` that allows an external account with either the `GOVERNOR` or `PSM_ADMIN_ROLE` role to set a new `GlobalRateLimitedMinter`. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `newMinter`: This parameter represents the new `GlobalRateLimitedMinter` contract address that will be set by the function.

Modifiers:
- `external`: This modifier specifies that the function can be called from outside the contract.
- `override`: This modifier indicates that the function is overriding a function from an inherited contract.
- `hasAnyOfTwoRoles`: This is a custom modifier that checks if the caller has either the `GOVERNOR` or `PSM_ADMIN_ROLE` role.

Functionality:
- The `setGlobalRateLimitedMinter` function is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- The function requires the caller to have either the `GOVERNOR` or `PSM_ADMIN_ROLE` role to execute the function successfully.
- When called, the function sets the new `GlobalRateLimitedMinter` contract address by calling the internal `_setGlobalRateLimitedMinter` function with the provided `newMinter` parameter.

Overall, this function provides a way for authorized accounts with specific roles to update the `GlobalRateLimitedMinter` contract address, ensuring that only privileged users can modify this critical component of the system.
