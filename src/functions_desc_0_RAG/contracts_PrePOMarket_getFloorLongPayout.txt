This code snippet defines an external view function named `getFloorLongPayout` that returns a `uint256` value representing the `floorLongPayout`. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Function Explanation:
- Visibility: The function is marked as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- View Function: The function is marked as `view`, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract and only reads data.
- Return Value: The function returns a `uint256` value representing the `floorLongPayout`.

Code Breakdown:
- The function `getFloorLongPayout` is defined with the `external` visibility modifier, allowing it to be called externally.
- The function is also marked as `view`, indicating that it does not modify the contract state.
- The function simply returns the value of the `floorLongPayout` variable.

Summary:
The `getFloorLongPayout` function is a simple external view function that returns the value of the `floorLongPayout` variable without modifying the contract state.
