This code defines an internal function named `_transfer`, which is responsible for transferring ownership of a token with a specific ID from one address to another. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `from`: The address from which the token is being transferred.
2. `to`: The address to which the token is being transferred.
3. `id`: The unique identifier of the token being transferred.

Code Breakdown:
The function starts with two `require` statements:
- The first `require` statement checks if the `from` address matches the current owner of the token with the specified ID. If they do not match, the function reverts with the error message "WRONG_FROM".
- The second `require` statement checks if the `to` address is not the zero address. If the `to` address is the zero address, the function reverts with the error message "INVALID_RECIPIENT".

Next, the function performs the token transfer:
- The function uses the `unchecked` block to prevent overflow/underflow issues. It decrements the balance of the `from` address by 1 and increments the balance of the `to` address by 1.
- The ownership of the token with the specified ID is updated to the `to` address.
- The approval status for the token ID is cleared by deleting the entry in the `getApproved` mapping.
- Finally, an `Transfer` event is emitted to log the transfer of the token from the `from` address to the `to` address.

Summary:
The `_transfer` function ensures that the token transfer is valid by checking the ownership of the token, the validity of the recipient address, and then updating the balances and ownership accordingly. It also emits a `Transfer` event to provide a transparent log of the token transfer.
