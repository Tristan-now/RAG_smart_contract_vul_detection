This code defines a function named `supportsInterface` that overrides the `supportsInterface` function from the `GovernorUpgradeable` and `GovernorTimelockControlUpgradeable` contracts. The function accepts a single parameter `interfaceId` of type `bytes4` and returns a boolean value.

Parameters:
1. `interfaceId`: A bytes4 value representing the interface ID to check for support.

Return Value:
The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the contract supports the specified interface.

Code Breakdown:
The `supportsInterface` function is a public view function that overrides the `supportsInterface` function from the `GovernorUpgradeable` and `GovernorTimelockControlUpgradeable` contracts. It takes a single parameter `interfaceId` of type `bytes4`. Inside the function, it calls the `super.supportsInterface(interfaceId)` function to delegate the interface support check to the parent contracts. The return value of this call is then returned by the `supportsInterface` function.

Vulnerability Prediction:
This function is a standard implementation of the `supportsInterface` function and does not exhibit any vulnerabilities based on the provided code snippet.

Summary:
The `supportsInterface` function in this code snippet simply delegates the interface support check to the parent contracts `GovernorUpgradeable` and `GovernorTimelockControlUpgradeable` by calling the `super.supportsInterface(interfaceId)` function and returning the result.
