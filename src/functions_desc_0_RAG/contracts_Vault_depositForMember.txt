This code defines a public function named `depositForMember`, which allows a specified member to deposit a certain amount of a synthetic asset (synth). The function performs the following steps:

Parameters:
1. `synth`: The address of the synthetic asset that the member wants to deposit.
2. `member`: The address of the member who is depositing the synthetic asset.
3. `amount`: The amount of the synthetic asset to be deposited.

Code Breakdown:
- The function first checks if the provided `synth` address is a valid synthetic asset by calling the `isSynth` function of the `iFACTORY` contract. If the provided `synth` address is not a synthetic asset, the function will revert with the error message "Not Synth".
- If the `synth` address is a valid synthetic asset, the function calls the `getFunds` function to transfer the specified `amount` of the synthetic asset to the contract. This function is assumed to handle the transfer of funds from the member to the contract.
- After successfully transferring the funds, the function calls the internal `_deposit` function with the `synth`, `member`, and `amount` parameters. This `_deposit` function is assumed to handle the actual deposit of the synthetic asset for the specified member.

Overall, the `depositForMember` function facilitates the deposit of a specified amount of a synthetic asset for a specific member, following the necessary checks and fund transfers.
