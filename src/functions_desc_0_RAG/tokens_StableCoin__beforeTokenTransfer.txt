This code snippet defines an internal function named `_beforeTokenTransfer`, which is used to perform actions before a token transfer occurs. The function accepts three parameters: `from` (the address from which the tokens are being transferred), `to` (the address to which the tokens are being transferred), and `amount` (the number of tokens being transferred).

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `from`: The address from which the tokens are being transferred.
2. `to`: The address to which the tokens are being transferred.
3. `amount`: The number of tokens being transferred.

Code Breakdown:
The `_beforeTokenTransfer` function is an internal function that overrides the `_beforeTokenTransfer` functions from the `ERC20` and `ERC20Pausable` contracts. It calls the `_beforeTokenTransfer` functions from these parent contracts using the `super` keyword to execute any actions defined in those functions before performing any additional actions specific to this contract.

Summary:
The `_beforeTokenTransfer` function serves as a hook that allows for additional actions to be taken before a token transfer occurs. By calling the parent contract's `_beforeTokenTransfer` functions, this function ensures that any necessary checks or operations defined in the parent contracts are executed before proceeding with the token transfer.
