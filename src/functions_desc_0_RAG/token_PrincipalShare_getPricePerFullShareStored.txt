This code defines an external function named `getPricePerFullShareStored`, which retrieves the price per full share stored in the pool. The function is marked as `view`, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract and can be called without consuming gas. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
This function does not accept any parameters.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the price per full share stored in the pool.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `external` visibility specifier, indicating that it can be called from outside the contract, and the `view` modifier, indicating that it does not modify the contract's state. The function name is `getPricePerFullShareStored`, and it overrides a function from an interface. Inside the function, it simply calls the `pricePerPrincipalShareStored` function on the `pool` contract and returns the result.

Vulnerability prediction:
This function is a simple read-only function that retrieves a value from the `pool` contract. As such, it does not introduce any specific vulnerabilities on its own.

Summary:
The `getPricePerFullShareStored` function is an external view function that retrieves the price per full share stored in the pool by calling the `pricePerPrincipalShareStored` function on the `pool` contract and returning the result.
