This code snippet defines an internal function named `_burn`, which is an override of a function from a parent contract. The function takes a single parameter `_id` of type `uint256`.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_id`: A `uint256` value representing the identifier of the bond to be burned.

Code Breakdown:
1. The function `_burn` is marked as `internal` and is an override of a function from the parent contract.
2. Within the function, the `_idToBond` mapping is used to delete the entry corresponding to the provided `_id`. This operation removes the bond associated with the given `_id`.
3. The `super._burn(_id)` statement is called to invoke the `_burn` function from the parent contract, which actually performs the burning operation. By calling `super._burn(_id)`, the function ensures that the parent contract's logic for burning is executed after deleting the bond entry.

Summary:
The `_burn` function internally deletes the bond entry associated with the provided `_id` using the `_idToBond` mapping and then calls the parent contract's `_burn` function to complete the burning process.
