This code snippet defines an external function named `totalSupply` that is used to retrieve the total supply of a token. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- `uint256`: The function returns a `uint256` value representing the total supply of the token.

Code Breakdown:
- The function `totalSupply` is defined as an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- The function is marked with the `view` and `override` keywords, indicating that it is a read-only function that overrides a function from an inherited contract.
- Within the function body, it simply returns the `_totalSupply` variable, which presumably stores the total supply of the token.

Summary:
- The `totalSupply` function provides a way to query the total supply of the token by returning the value stored in the `_totalSupply` variable.
