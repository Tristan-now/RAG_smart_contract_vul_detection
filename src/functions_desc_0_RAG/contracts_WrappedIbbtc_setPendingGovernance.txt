This code snippet defines an external function named `setPendingGovernance` that allows the current governance address to set a new pending governance address. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_pendingGovernance`: The new pending governance address that the current governance address wants to set.

Modifiers:
- `onlyGovernance`: This modifier restricts the execution of the function to only the current governance address.

Functionality:
- The function `setPendingGovernance` takes the `_pendingGovernance` address as input and assigns it to the `pendingGovernance` state variable.
- After assigning the new pending governance address, the function emits an event `SetPendingGovernance` to notify the blockchain network about the change.

Summary:
The `setPendingGovernance` function allows the current governance address to propose a new pending governance address. This mechanism enables a smooth transition of governance control within the smart contract system.
