This code defines an internal function named `scryRollers`, which is used to search for specific data points within an array of `Roller` structs. The function accepts three parameters: an array of `Roller` structs (`rollers`), an unsigned integer `_cycloid`, and another unsigned integer `_target`. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `rollers`: An array of `Roller` structs that stores information about different rollers.
2. `_cycloid`: An unsigned integer representing a specific index within the `rollers` array.
3. `_target`: An unsigned integer representing the target value to search for within the `rollers` array.

Return Values:
The function returns two `Roller` structs: `beforeOrAt_` and `atOrAfter_`, which represent the roller data before or at the target value and the roller data at or after the target value, respectively.

Code Breakdown:
The function first initializes the `beforeOrAt_` struct with the roller data at the specified `_cycloid` index within the `rollers` array.
If the timestamp of the `beforeOrAt_` roller is less than or equal to the target value `_target`, the function checks if the timestamps are equal. If they are equal, it returns the `beforeOrAt_` struct and an empty `atOrAfter_` struct since they are in the same block.
If the timestamps are not equal, the function sets the `atOrAfter_` struct with the current block timestamp and copies the `ying` and `yang` values from the `beforeOrAt_` roller.
If the target value is not found in the current roller, the function updates the `_cycloid` index to point to the next roller in the array.
It then checks if the timestamp of the new `beforeOrAt_` roller is less than or equal to 1 and resets it to the first roller if necessary.
If the target value is found in the new `beforeOrAt_` roller, the function returns both `beforeOrAt_` and `atOrAfter_` as the same roller.
If the target value is not found in the current or next roller, the function calls a binary search function to find the appropriate rollers based on the target value.

Overall, the `scryRollers` function efficiently searches for specific data points within the array of `Roller` structs and returns the relevant information based on the target value provided.
