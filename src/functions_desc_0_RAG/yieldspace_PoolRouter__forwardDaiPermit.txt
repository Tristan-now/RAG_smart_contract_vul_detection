This code defines a private function named `_forwardDaiPermit` that facilitates the forwarding of a permit function call for the Dai token. The function takes in several parameters to execute the permit function for the Dai token. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `addresses`: A struct named `PoolAddresses` that contains the addresses of various pools.
2. `spender`: The address that is allowed to spend the Dai tokens on behalf of the owner.
3. `nonce`: A unique number used to prevent replay attacks.
4. `deadline`: The timestamp after which the permit is considered expired.
5. `allowed`: A boolean value indicating whether the spender is allowed to spend the tokens.
6. `v`, `r`, `s`: The components of the ECDSA signature used to validate the permit.

Code Breakdown:
The `_forwardDaiPermit` function is a private function, meaning it can only be called within the contract itself. It takes in the `PoolAddresses` struct, `spender`, `nonce`, `deadline`, `allowed`, and the ECDSA signature components `v`, `r`, `s` as parameters.

Within the function, it calls the `permit` function of the Dai token contract using the `DaiAbstract` interface. The `permit` function allows the owner to set approval for a spender to spend Dai tokens on their behalf without the need for a separate transaction to approve.

The `permit` function is called with the following parameters:
- `msg.sender`: The address of the caller of the contract.
- `spender`: The address that is allowed to spend the Dai tokens.
- `nonce`: A unique number to prevent replay attacks.
- `deadline`: The timestamp after which the permit is considered expired.
- `allowed`: A boolean value indicating whether the spender is allowed to spend the tokens.
- `v`, `r`, `s`: The components of the ECDSA signature used to validate the permit.

Overall, this function facilitates the forwarding of a permit function call for the Dai token, allowing the spender to spend Dai tokens on behalf of the owner with the specified permissions and signature validation.
