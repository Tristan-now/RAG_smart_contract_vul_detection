This code snippet defines an internal function named `_authorizeUpgrade` that is used for authorization during the upgrade process of a smart contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `newImplementation`: This parameter represents the address of the new implementation contract that is being authorized for upgrade.

Functionality:
The `_authorizeUpgrade` function is marked as `internal`, meaning it can only be accessed within the contract or its derived contracts. The function is designed to handle the authorization logic for upgrading the contract to a new implementation.

Authorization:
The function includes an `override` modifier, indicating that it overrides a function from a parent contract. In this case, it overrides the authorization logic for upgrading the contract.

Access Control:
The function includes the `onlyOwner` modifier, which restricts access to the function to only the owner of the contract. This ensures that only the owner has the authority to authorize the upgrade to a new implementation.

Summary:
The `_authorizeUpgrade` function is an internal function that enforces access control by allowing only the contract owner to authorize the upgrade to a new implementation. This function plays a crucial role in ensuring the security and integrity of the upgrade process within the smart contract.
