This code snippet defines an external function named `totalSupply` that is used to retrieve the total supply of a token. The function is marked as `view` and `override`, indicating that it is a read-only function that overrides a function from a parent contract.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- `uint256`: The function returns a `uint256` value representing the total supply of the token.

Code Breakdown:
- The `totalSupply` function is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- The function is marked as `view`, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract.
- The `override` keyword is used to explicitly indicate that this function is overriding a function from a parent contract.
- Within the function body, it simply returns the `_totalSupply` variable, which presumably stores the total supply of the token.

Summary:
The `totalSupply` function provides a way to query the total supply of the token without modifying any state variables. It is a standard function commonly found in ERC20 token contracts to allow external parties to retrieve information about the token supply.
