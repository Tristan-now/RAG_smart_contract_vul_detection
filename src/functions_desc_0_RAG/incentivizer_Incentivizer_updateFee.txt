This code snippet defines a function named `updateFee` that allows the owner of the smart contract to update the fee value. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `newFee`: A parameter of type `UFixed18` representing the new fee value that the owner wants to set.

Function Signature:
- `updateFee(UFixed18 newFee)`: This function takes a single parameter `newFee` of type `UFixed18` and is marked as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.

Function Logic:
- Inside the function, the `fee` variable in the contract is updated with the new value passed as `newFee`.
- An event `FeeUpdated` is emitted to log the update of the fee value with the new value passed.

Access Control:
- The function is restricted to be called only by the owner of the contract, as indicated by the `onlyOwner` modifier. This ensures that only the owner can update the fee value.

Overall, this function provides a way for the contract owner to dynamically update the fee value, which can be useful for adjusting fees based on changing conditions or requirements.

[REFERENCE VULNERABILITY REPORTS]
