This code snippet defines an external function named `changeTreasury` that allows only the admin to update the treasury address. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_treasury`: The new address that will be assigned to the `treasury` variable.

Functionality:
The `changeTreasury` function is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. It takes one parameter `_treasury`, which represents the new address that will be assigned to the `treasury` variable. The `treasury` variable is likely a state variable that stores the address of the treasury.

Access Control:
The function includes a modifier `adminOnly`, which is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet. This modifier is assumed to restrict access to only the admin of the contract. Therefore, only the admin can call this function to update the treasury address.

Updating Treasury Address:
Within the function, the `_treasury` address provided as an argument is assigned to the `treasury` variable. This operation effectively updates the treasury address to the new value specified by the admin.

Overall, this function provides a way for the admin to change the treasury address, ensuring that only authorized individuals can modify this critical parameter in the contract.
