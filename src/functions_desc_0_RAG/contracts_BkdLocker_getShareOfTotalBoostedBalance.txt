This code defines an external view function named `getShareOfTotalBoostedBalance`, which calculates the share of a user's boosted balance relative to the total locked boosted balance. The function accepts one parameter:

Parameter:
1. `user`: The address of the user for whom the share of boosted balance needs to be calculated.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the user's share of the total locked boosted balance.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameter `user`. `getShareOfTotalBoostedBalance` is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the state of the contract. The function calculates the user's share of the total boosted balance by performing the following operations:
1. Accessing the `balances` mapping to retrieve the user's balance.
2. Multiplying the user's balance by the corresponding boost factor stored in the `boostFactors` mapping for that user.
3. Dividing the result by the `totalLockedBoosted` variable.

Vulnerability Prediction:
This function is a simple view function that performs basic arithmetic operations on stored data. As such, it is not vulnerable to common smart contract vulnerabilities like reentrancy, arithmetic overflow, or unauthorized access.

Summary:
The `getShareOfTotalBoostedBalance` function calculates the share of a user's boosted balance relative to the total locked boosted balance by multiplying the user's balance with their boost factor and dividing the result by the total locked boosted balance.
