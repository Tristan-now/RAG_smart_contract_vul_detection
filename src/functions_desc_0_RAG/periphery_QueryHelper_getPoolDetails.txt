This function `getPoolDetails` takes in an `IOpenLev` contract instance, an array of `marketIds`, and an array of `LPoolInterface` contracts. It returns an array of `PoolVars` structs containing various details about each pool.

Parameters:
1. `openLev`: An instance of the `IOpenLev` contract.
2. `marketIds`: An array of `uint16` market IDs.
3. `pools`: An array of `LPoolInterface` contracts.

Return Value:
An array of `PoolVars` structs containing details about each pool.

Code Breakdown:
1. Initialize an array `results` of type `PoolVars` with a length equal to the number of pools.
2. Iterate over each pool in the `pools` array.
3. Get the `LPoolInterface` contract instance for the current pool.
4. Retrieve the market details for the corresponding market ID from the `openLev` contract.
5. Create a new `PoolVars` struct named `item` to store pool details.
6. Populate the `item` struct with the following details:
   - `insurance`: Determine the insurance address based on the pool type.
   - `cash`: Get the current cash balance of the pool.
   - `totalBorrows`: Get the total amount borrowed from the pool.
   - `totalReserves`: Get the total reserves held by the pool.
   - `availableForBorrow`: Get the amount available for borrowing from the pool.
   - `supplyRatePerBlock`: Get the supply interest rate per block for the pool.
   - `borrowRatePerBlock`: Get the borrow interest rate per block for the pool.
   - `reserveFactorMantissa`: Get the reserve factor for the pool.
   - `exchangeRate`: Get the stored exchange rate for the pool.
   - `baseRatePerBlock`: Get the base interest rate per block for the pool.
   - `multiplierPerBlock`: Get the interest rate multiplier per block for the pool.
   - `jumpMultiplierPerBlock`: Get the jump multiplier per block for the pool.
   - `kink`: Get the kink value for the pool.
7. Assign the `item` struct to the corresponding index in the `results` array.
8. Return the array `results` containing details of all pools.
