This code snippet defines a public view function named `vcon` that overrides a function from an interface. The function returns an `IERC20` interface instance `_vcon`.

Explanation:
- The function `vcon` is declared as public and view, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the state of the contract.
- The function is marked with the `override` keyword, indicating that it overrides a function from an interface or a base contract.
- The function returns an instance of the `IERC20` interface, which represents an ERC20 token contract.
- The return value is `_vcon`, which is presumably a state variable of type `IERC20` that holds a reference to an ERC20 token contract.

In summary, the `vcon` function provides external visibility to access the `_vcon` variable, which is an instance of an ERC20 token contract.
