This code snippet defines an internal function `_reducePosition` that is responsible for reducing a trader's position in a trading system. The function takes three parameters: `trader` (address of the trader), `baseAssetQuantity` (integer representing the quantity of the base asset to be reduced), and `quoteAssetLimit` (unsigned integer representing the limit of the quote asset).

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. The function first retrieves the trader's notional position and unrealized profit/loss using the `getTakerNotionalPositionAndUnrealizedPnl` function.

2. It then accesses the trader's position from the `positions` mapping and determines if it is a long position based on the size of the position.

3. If the position is a long position, it updates the `longOpenInterestNotional` variable by subtracting the absolute value of the `baseAssetQuantity` and calls the `_short` function to handle the reduction in the position by shorting the base asset.

4. If the position is a short position, it updates the `shortOpenInterestNotional` variable by subtracting the `baseAssetQuantity` and calls the `_long` function to handle the reduction in the position by longing the base asset.

5. The function then calculates the notional position after reducing the base asset quantity by calling the `getCloseQuote` function.

6. It calculates the open notional and realized profit/loss after reducing the position by calling the `getOpenNotionalWhileReducingPosition` function.

7. Finally, it updates the trader's position size by adding the `baseAssetQuantity`.

Overall, the `_reducePosition` function is responsible for reducing a trader's position in the trading system by adjusting the open interest, executing the necessary trades to reduce the position, and updating the trader's position details accordingly.
