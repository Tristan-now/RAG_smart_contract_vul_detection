This code defines a function named `applyPendingOwner` that can be called externally. The function requires two conditions to be met before executing the owner transfer process:

1. The caller of the function must be the current owner of the contract.
2. There must be a pending owner address set (not equal to address(0)).

If both conditions are satisfied, the function transfers the ownership by assigning the value of `pendingOwner` to `owner` and then resets `pendingOwner` to address(0) to clear the pending owner status.

Here's a detailed breakdown of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- None

Code Breakdown:
- The function `applyPendingOwner` is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- The function first checks if the caller of the function is the current owner of the contract using `require(msg.sender == owner, "!auth")`. If this condition is not met, the function will revert with the error message "!auth".
- Next, it checks if there is a pending owner address set by verifying that `pendingOwner` is not equal to address(0) using `require(pendingOwner != address(0), "invalid owner")`. If this condition is not met, the function will revert with the error message "invalid owner".
- If both conditions are met, the function proceeds to transfer the ownership by assigning the value of `pendingOwner` to `owner`, effectively changing the owner of the contract.
- Finally, the function resets `pendingOwner` to address(0) to clear the pending owner status.

Vulnerability Prediction:
This function does not exhibit any vulnerabilities based on the provided code snippet.

Summary:
The `applyPendingOwner` function allows the current owner of the contract to transfer ownership to a pending owner address. It enforces authorization by checking the caller's address and ensures that a valid pending owner address is set before executing the ownership transfer process.
