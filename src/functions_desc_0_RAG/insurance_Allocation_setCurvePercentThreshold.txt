This code snippet defines an external function named `setCurvePercentThreshold` that allows the contract owner to set a new value for the `curvePercentThreshold` variable. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_curvePercentThreshold`: This is a `uint256` parameter representing the new curve percent threshold value that the owner wants to set.

Functionality:
- The function `setCurvePercentThreshold` is marked as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- The function can only be called by the contract owner, as indicated by the `onlyOwner` modifier.
- When called, the function takes the input parameter `_curvePercentThreshold` and assigns it to the `curvePercentThreshold` variable.
- After updating the `curvePercentThreshold` variable, the function emits a `LogNewCurveThreshold` event, providing the new value of the curve percent threshold.

Overall, this function provides a way for the contract owner to dynamically adjust the curve percent threshold, which can be useful for fine-tuning the contract's behavior based on changing conditions or requirements.
