This code snippet defines an internal function named `_getOwner` that overrides the `view` function from the `ERC1271` contract. The function returns the address of the owner of the contract by calling the `owner()` function from the `OwnableERC721` contract.

Explanation:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- `ownerAddress`: The function returns the address of the owner of the contract.

Code Breakdown:
- The `_getOwner` function is marked as internal, meaning it can only be accessed within the contract or its derived contracts.
- The function overrides the `view` function from the `ERC1271` contract, indicating that it provides read-only access to the contract state.
- Within the function, the `owner()` function is called on the `OwnableERC721` contract to retrieve the address of the contract owner.
- The retrieved owner address is then returned as the output of the `_getOwner` function.

Vulnerability Prediction:
- This code snippet does not exhibit any vulnerabilities based on the provided information.

Summary:
- The `_getOwner` function is an internal view function that returns the address of the owner of the contract by calling the `owner()` function from the `OwnableERC721` contract.
