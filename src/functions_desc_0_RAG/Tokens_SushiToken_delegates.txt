This code defines an external view function named `delegates` that retrieves the delegate address for a given delegator. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `delegator`: The address of the delegator for whom the delegate address needs to be retrieved.

Return Value:
The function returns the delegate address associated with the provided `delegator` address.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `delegates` function, which is marked as external and view. This means that it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the contract's state.
The function takes a single parameter `delegator`, which is the address of the delegator for whom the delegate address needs to be retrieved.
Within the function, it simply returns the delegate address associated with the provided `delegator` address from the `_delegates` mapping.

Summary:
The `delegates` function allows external callers to query and retrieve the delegate address for a given delegator. It provides transparency and visibility into the delegation relationships within the contract.
