This code snippet defines an external function named `setTreasuryAddress` that allows the contract owner to set the treasury address. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_treasury`: The new address that will be set as the treasury address.

Functionality:
The function `setTreasuryAddress` is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. It takes one parameter `_treasury`, which is the new address to be set as the treasury address. The function is marked with the `override` modifier, indicating that it overrides a function from an inherited interface or contract.

Code Breakdown:
- The function body simply assigns the value of `_treasury` to the `treasury` state variable.
- The `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to this function to only the owner of the contract. This ensures that only the contract owner can change the treasury address.

Summary:
The `setTreasuryAddress` function provides a way for the contract owner to update the treasury address. By calling this function with a new address as the parameter, the owner can change the treasury address to a different value.
