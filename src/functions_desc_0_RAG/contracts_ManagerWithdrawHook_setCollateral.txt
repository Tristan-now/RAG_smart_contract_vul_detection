This code snippet defines a function named `setCollateral` that allows setting a new collateral address for a contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_newCollateral`: This parameter of type `ICollateral` represents the new collateral address that will be set.

Functionality:
- The function `setCollateral` is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- The function is marked with the `override` keyword, indicating that it overrides a function from a parent contract or interface.
- The function is restricted to be called only by a specific role with the `onlyRole(SET_COLLATERAL_ROLE)` modifier. This ensures that only authorized users can change the collateral address.
- Inside the function, the `collateral` state variable is updated with the new collateral address `_newCollateral`.
- An event `CollateralChange` is emitted with the address of the new collateral as the parameter.

Overall, this function provides a way to update the collateral address used by the contract, ensuring that only authorized users with the `SET_COLLATERAL_ROLE` can perform this action.

[REFERENCE VULNERABILITY REPORTS]
- No specific vulnerability reports are referenced in this case.

[TASK CODE]
```solidity
function setCollateral(ICollateral _newCollateral) external override onlyRole(SET_COLLATERAL_ROLE) {
    collateral = _newCollateral;
    emit CollateralChange(address(_newCollateral));
}
