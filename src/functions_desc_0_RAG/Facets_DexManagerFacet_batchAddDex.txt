This code defines an external function named `batchAddDex`, which allows the contract owner to add multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to a whitelist. The function accepts an array of addresses (`_dexs`) representing the DEXs to be added.

Parameters:
1. `_dexs`: An array of addresses that stores the addresses of multiple DEXs to be added to the whitelist.

Functionality:
- The function starts by calling `LibDiamond.enforceIsContractOwner()` to ensure that only the contract owner can execute this function.
- It then iterates over the `_dexs` array using a `for` loop. For each address in the array:
  - If the address is already present in the `dexWhitelist` mapping (indicating it is already whitelisted), the loop continues to the next address.
  - If the address is not in the whitelist, it is added to the `dexWhitelist` mapping and also pushed to the `dexs` array.

Overall, the `batchAddDex` function allows the contract owner to efficiently add multiple DEXs to the whitelist, ensuring that each DEX is only added once and maintaining a list of all whitelisted DEXs.
