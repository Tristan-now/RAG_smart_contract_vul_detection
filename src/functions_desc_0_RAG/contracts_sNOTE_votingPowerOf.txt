This code snippet defines an external function named `votingPowerOf` that takes an `account` address as a parameter and returns the voting power associated with that account. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account`: The address of the account for which the voting power needs to be calculated.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the voting power of the specified account.

Code Breakdown:
The `votingPowerOf` function is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. It takes an `account` address as a parameter.
Inside the function, it calls another function `getVotingPower` and passes the balance of the `account` as an argument to calculate the voting power.
The `getVotingPower` function is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract or inherited from another contract. It calculates the voting power based on the balance of the account.
The voting power calculation logic is not provided in the given code snippet, so it is assumed that the `getVotingPower` function handles this calculation based on the account balance.

Vulnerability Prediction:
Since the code snippet provided is a simple read-only function that calculates the voting power based on the account balance, there are no apparent vulnerabilities in this specific code snippet.

Summary:
The `votingPowerOf` function is an external view function that calculates and returns the voting power associated with a specific account. It achieves this by calling another function `getVotingPower` with the account balance as an argument to determine the voting power.
