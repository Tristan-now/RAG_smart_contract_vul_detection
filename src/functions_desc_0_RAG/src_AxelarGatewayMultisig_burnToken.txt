This code snippet defines an external function named `burnToken` that takes in two parameters: `params` of type `bytes calldata` and `bytes32`. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `params`: A dynamic array of bytes that contains encoded data.
2. `bytes32`: A fixed-size byte array of 32 bytes.

Code Breakdown:
- The `burnToken` function is marked as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- The function accepts two parameters: `params` and `bytes32`.
- Inside the function, the `abi.decode` function is used to decode the `params` array into a tuple containing a `string` variable named `symbol` and a `bytes32` variable named `salt`.
- The `_burnToken` function is then called with the decoded `symbol` and `salt` as arguments.

Summary:
The `burnToken` function decodes the input `params` array to extract a `symbol` and `salt`, which are then passed to the `_burnToken` function for further processing.

[REFERENCE VULNERABILITY REPORTS]
- No specific vulnerability reports are referenced in this case.

[TASK CODE]
```solidity
function burnToken(bytes calldata params, bytes32) external onlySelf {
    (string memory symbol, bytes32 salt) = abi.decode(params, (string, bytes32));

    _burnToken(symbol, salt);
}
