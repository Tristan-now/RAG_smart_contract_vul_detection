This code snippet defines an external view function named `getInternalTotalSupply` that is part of a smart contract. The function retrieves and returns the value of the `internalTotalSupply` variable stored in the `SherXStorage` contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- `uint256`: The function returns a `uint256` value representing the total internal supply of the token.

Code Breakdown:
- The function signature specifies that it is an external view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract's state.
- Within the function, it calls the `sx()` function on the `SherXStorage` contract to access the storage variable `internalTotalSupply`.
- The value of `internalTotalSupply` is then returned as the output of the `getInternalTotalSupply` function.

Vulnerability Prediction:
- This function does not appear to have any specific vulnerabilities based on the provided code snippet. However, it is important to ensure that access control mechanisms are in place to restrict who can call this function and that the value returned is accurate and secure.

Summary:
- The `getInternalTotalSupply` function provides external visibility into the total internal supply of the token by retrieving and returning the value of the `internalTotalSupply` variable stored in the `SherXStorage` contract.
