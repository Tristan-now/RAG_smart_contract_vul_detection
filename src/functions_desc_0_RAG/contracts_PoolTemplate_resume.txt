This code defines an external function named `resume` that is used to resume market operations after a payout period. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- No external parameters are passed to the function.

Code Breakdown:
1. The function starts with a `require` statement to ensure that the market status is set to `Payingout` and the pending end time has passed before resuming. If the conditions are not met, an error message is thrown.

2. The function then retrieves the total debt of the contract from the `vault` and stores it in the variable `_debt`. It also fetches the total credit and calculates the deduction from the index based on the debt, total credit, and total liquidity using a magic scale factor `MAGIC_SCALE_1E6`.

3. A loop iterates over the `indexList` array, which contains addresses of indices. For each index, it calculates the share of credit, redeems the deduction from the index, and adds the actual deduction by calling the `compensate` function of the `IIndexTemplate` contract.

4. After calculating the deduction from the index, the function computes the deduction from the pool, shortage amount, and performs the necessary debt offset and transfer operations.

5. If there is a deduction from the pool, it offsets the debt in the `vault` contract using the `offsetDebt` function.

6. Finally, the function transfers the shortage amount from the market to the `vault`, updates the market status to `Trading`, and emits an event indicating the change in market status.

Summary:
The `resume` function is responsible for resuming market operations after a payout period. It calculates deductions from indices, offsets debt in the vault, transfers any shortage amount, and updates the market status to `Trading`.
