This code snippet consists of a smart contract function named `vest` and a SafeMath library that provides safe arithmetic operations for uint256 variables. Let's break down the working process of this code:

**Smart Contract Function:**
The `vest` function is defined as an external function that takes three parameters: `_beneficiary` (address), `_amount` (uint256), and `_isRevocable` (uint256). The function is payable, meaning it can receive Ether along with the function call.

**Parameters:**
1. `_beneficiary`: The address of the beneficiary who will receive the vested amount.
2. `_amount`: The amount of tokens to be vested.
3. `_isRevocable`: A flag indicating whether the vesting is revocable or not.

**SafeMath Library:**
The SafeMath library provides safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow vulnerabilities in uint256 arithmetic operations. It includes functions like `sub`, `mul`, and `div` with error handling to ensure safe mathematical operations.

**SafeMath Functions:**
1. `sub`: Subtracts two uint256 numbers and checks for underflow. If the result is negative, it reverts with an error message.
2. `mul`: Multiplies two uint256 numbers and checks for overflow. If the result exceeds the maximum value, it reverts with an error message.
3. `div`: Divides two uint256 numbers and checks for division by zero. If the divisor is zero, it reverts with an error message.

**Working Process:**
- The `vest` function allows a user to vest a specified amount of tokens to a beneficiary address.
- The function performs safe arithmetic operations using the SafeMath library to prevent overflow and underflow issues.
- The function is external, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- The function is payable, indicating that it can receive Ether along with the function call.

In summary, the `vest` function facilitates the vesting of tokens to a beneficiary address while ensuring safe arithmetic operations using the SafeMath library to prevent common vulnerabilities related to integer arithmetic.
