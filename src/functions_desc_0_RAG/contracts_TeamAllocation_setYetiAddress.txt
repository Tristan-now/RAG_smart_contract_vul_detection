This code snippet defines an external function named `setYetiAddress` that allows the contract owner (presumably the team) to set the address of a specific ERC20 token (referred to as `_YETI`) to be used within the contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_YETI`: This parameter is of type `IERC20` and represents the address of the ERC20 token that the contract will interact with.

Modifiers:
- `onlyTeam`: This modifier restricts the execution of the `setYetiAddress` function to only the team members or the contract owner.

Functionality:
- The `setYetiAddress` function sets the value of the contract's `YETI` variable to the provided `_YETI` address.
- It also sets the `yetiSet` boolean variable to `true`, indicating that the `_YETI` address has been successfully set.

Overall, this function allows the contract owner to specify the ERC20 token address that the contract will work with, ensuring that the contract can interact with the specified token.
