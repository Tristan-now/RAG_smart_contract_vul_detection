This code defines an internal function named `sumTokensInPeg`, which calculates the total value of a collection of tokens. The function accepts three parameters: an array of addresses (`tokens`), a mapping of amounts (`amounts`), and a boolean (`forceCurBlock`). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `tokens`: An array of addresses that stores the addresses of multiple tokens.
2. `amounts`: A mapping where the key is the token address and the value is the corresponding token amount.
3. `forceCurBlock`: A boolean that indicates whether to force the use of the current block.

Return Value:
`totalPeg`: The function returns a `uint256` value representing the sum of the total values of all tokens.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `tokens`, `amounts`, and `forceCurBlock`. `sumTokensInPeg` is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts three parameters: `tokens` (an array of token addresses), `amounts` (a mapping of token amounts), and `forceCurBlock` (a boolean value). The function returns a `uint256` variable named `totalPeg`, initialized to 0. This variable will store the total value of all tokens. The variable `len` stores the length of the `tokens` array, which is used to control the number of iterations in the loop. A `for` loop is used to iterate over the `tokens` array. The loop starts with `tokenId` initialized to 0 and runs until `tokenId` is less than `len`, incrementing `tokenId` by 1 each iteration. In each iteration, the current token address is obtained using `tokens[tokenId]` and stored in the variable `token`. For each token, the `PriceAware.getCurrentPriceInPeg` function is called. This function requires three parameters: the token address `token`, the token amount `amounts[token]`, and the boolean `forceCurBlock`. The result of this function call (the current price of the token in peg units) is added to the `totalPeg` variable.

Summary:
The `sumTokensInPeg` function iterates over a given array of token addresses (`tokens`), retrieves the corresponding token amount from the `amounts` mapping, and calls the `PriceAware.getCurrentPriceInPeg` function to get the current price of each token in peg units. It then sums these prices to calculate the total value of all tokens in peg units and returns this total value.
