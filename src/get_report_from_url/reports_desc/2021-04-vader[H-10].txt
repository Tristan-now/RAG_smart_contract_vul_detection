Type of vulnerability: Permissionless token listing vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of proper access control and weak token verification
Execution process: Attacker can call Pools.addLiquidity(VADER, token, _) to set token as an anchor without actually sending any tokens, then use flash loans to manipulate prices and potentially remove rewards from curated pools.
Detailed characteristics: The vulnerability allows anyone to list anchors and curate tokens without proper verification, potentially leading to price manipulation and reward removal from curated pools.
Vulnerable code: 
```
function listAnchor(token) {
    require(iPOOLS(POOLS).isAnchor(token));
    // Lack of proper access control and weak token verification
}
```
