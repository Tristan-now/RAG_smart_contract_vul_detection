Type of vulnerability: Sandwich attack
Cause of vulnerability: Lack of slippage protection in buyCvx() and sellCvx() functions
Execution process: Users interacting directly with the VotiumStrategy contract are susceptible to sandwich attacks when calling functions like deposit(), depositRewards(), and withdraw() without slippage protection.
Detailed characteristics: The exchange_underlying() function is called with a _min_dy parameter of 0, allowing attackers to manipulate the swap to their advantage.
Vulnerable code: 
```
VotiumStrategyCore.sol#L233-L240
ICrvEthPool(CVX_ETH_CRV_POOL_ADDRESS).exchange_underlying{value:_ethAmountIn}(0,1,_ethAmountIn,0// this is handled at the afEth level);
VotiumStrategyCore.sol#L258-L263
ICrvEthPool(CVX_ETH_CRV_POOL_ADDRESS).exchange_underlying(1,0,_cvxAmountIn,0// this is handled at the afEth level);
```
