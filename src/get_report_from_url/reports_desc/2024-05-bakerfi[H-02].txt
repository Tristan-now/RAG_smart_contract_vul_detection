Type of vulnerability: First depositor inflation attack
Cause of vulnerability: The Vault's shares and assets are not initialized/seeded when the Vault is created, and the totalAssets is dependent on the total aCollateralTokens the associated Strategy to the Vault is holding on its balance.
Execution process: 
1. The first depositor (Alice) deposits a small amount of ETH and receives shares based on the initial state of the Vault.
2. Alice sends a large amount of aCollateralToken directly to the Strategy associated with the Vault, inflating the totalAssets.
3. Subsequent depositors (like Bob) deposit ETH based on the inflated totalAssets, resulting in a discrepancy between the shares they receive and the actual value of their deposit.
4. The attacker (Alice) can then profit by withdrawing the initial shares, all the aCollateralTokens transferred, and a portion of the deposited value from real depositors.
Detailed characteristics: The vulnerability stems from the lack of initialization/seeding of shares and assets in the Vault, allowing for manipulation of the share-assets rate by inflating the totalAssets through direct transfer of aCollateralTokens to the Strategy.
Vulnerable code: 
```solidity
function deposit(address receiver)...
{
...
Rebase memory total = Rebase(_totalAssets(maxPriceAge), totalSupply());
...
bytes memory result = (address(_strategy)).functionCallWithValue(abi.encodeWithSignature("deploy()"),msg.value);
uint256 amount = abi.decode(result, (uint256));
...
shares = total.toBase(amount, false);
_mint(receiver, shares);
emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, msg.value, shares);
}
```
