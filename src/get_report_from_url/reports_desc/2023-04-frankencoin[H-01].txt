Type of vulnerability: Front-running vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Challenges cannot be closed once created, allowing position owners to frontrun challengers by adjusting the price and causing challengers to lose their collateral in bidding.
Execution process: 
1. Position owner creates a challenge and frontruns it by adjusting the price to 0 with a repayment and adjustPrice call.
2. Challenger puts up collateral for bids.
3. Position owner backruns the challenger's call with a bid that triggers the avert, claiming the challenger's collateral.
Detailed characteristics: The vulnerability allows position owners to manipulate the price and collateral checks in challenges, causing challengers to lose their collateral in bidding wars.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
