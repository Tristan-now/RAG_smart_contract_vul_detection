Type of vulnerability: Reentrancy
Cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability allows a malicious user to mint additional fighter NFTs by leveraging reentrancy in the claimRewards() function.
Execution process: 
1. An in-session fight round gets finalized.
2. Admin picks winners for the just finalized round.
3. A winner, Alice, who is entitled to 2 fighter NFTs, decides to claim rewards for the rounds she participated in using a smart contract.
4. Alice calls claimRewards with valid arguments, triggering the minting of 2 NFTs to her address.
5. Alice's smart contract reenters the call to mint additional NFTs, resulting in Alice gaining more than 2 fighter NFTs.
Detailed characteristics: The vulnerability allows for reentrancy in the claimRewards function based on the roundId, enabling a malicious user to mint more fighter NFTs than they are owed.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function claimRewards(string[] calldata modelURIs, string[] calldata modelTypes, uint256[2][] calldata customAttributes) {
    // Implementation of claimRewards function
    // Vulnerability lies in the reentrancy possibility based on roundId
}
```
