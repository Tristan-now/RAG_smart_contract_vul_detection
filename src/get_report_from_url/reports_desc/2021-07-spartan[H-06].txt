Type of vulnerability: AMM price oracle manipulation
Cause of vulnerability: The weight calculation for users in the SynthVault contract depends on the spot value of the deposit synth amount in BASE, which can be manipulated.
Execution process: By manipulating the pool spot price of the iSYNTH pool by dripping a lot of BASE into it repeatedly, a user can inflate their weight compared to the deposited amount and claim a large share of the rewards.
Detailed characteristics: The reward is measured in BASE tokens unrelated to the pool's liquidity, making it profitable for an attacker under certain circumstances, depending on the pool's liquidity and reward reserve.
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
function _deposit(uint _amount, uint _minShares, bool _isStake) internal {
    // Add weight for the user that depends on the spot value of the deposit synth amount in BASE
    uint weight = iUTILS(_DAO().UTILS()).calcSpotValueInBase(iSYNTH(_synth).LayerONE(), _amount);
    // Other deposit logic
}
```
