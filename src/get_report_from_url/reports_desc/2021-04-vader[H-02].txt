Type of vulnerability: Flash attack vulnerability
Cause of vulnerability: Failure to initialize the blockDelay state variable
Execution process: The blockDelay state variable is not initialized, allowing the current executing context to be the same as the previous one, enabling flash attacks.
Detailed characteristics: The blockDelay state variable needs to be initialized to at least 1 to prevent flash attacks, but it is not set to any value by default.
Vulnerable code: 

```solidity
uint blockDelay;

modifier flashProof() {
    require(lastBlock[tx.origin] + blockDelay <= block.number, "Flash attack detected");
    _;
}

function isMature() internal flashProof {
    // Function implementation
}
```
