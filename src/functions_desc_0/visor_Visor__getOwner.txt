This code defines an internal function named `_getOwner` that overrides the `view` function from the `ERC1271` contract. The purpose of this function is to retrieve the owner address of the contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- `ownerAddress`: The function returns an `address` value representing the owner address of the contract.

Code Breakdown:
- The function signature includes the `internal` and `view` modifiers, indicating that it is an internal function that only provides read-only access to the contract state.
- The function overrides the `_getOwner` function from the `ERC1271` contract, ensuring that the contract implements the required functionality defined in `ERC1271`.
- Within the function body, the `OwnableERC721.owner()` function is called to retrieve the owner address of the contract. This function is likely defined in the `OwnableERC721` contract and returns the address of the owner of the ERC721 contract.

Summary:
The `_getOwner` function provides a way to access the owner address of the contract by calling the `OwnableERC721.owner()` function. This function is essential for verifying ownership and implementing access control within the smart contract.
