This code defines an internal view function named `_implementation`, which is used to retrieve the address of the child implementation contract from the Beacon contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- `address`: The function returns an `address` value representing the address of the child implementation contract.

Code Breakdown:
- The function signature includes the keyword `internal`, `view`, `virtual`, and `override`, indicating that this function is internal, view-only, can be overridden by derived contracts, and overrides a function from a parent contract.
- The function body consists of a single line of code that calls the `childImplementation` function on the Beacon contract obtained from the `_beacon()` function. This function call returns the address of the child implementation contract.

Summary:
- The `_implementation` function is a view function that retrieves the address of the child implementation contract from the Beacon contract by calling the `childImplementation` function. This allows the contract to dynamically fetch the address of the current implementation contract from the Beacon contract.
