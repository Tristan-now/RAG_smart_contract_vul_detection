This code defines an external function named `setDev` that allows an admin to set the developer address. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_devaddr`: The new developer address that the admin wants to set.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `external` visibility specifier, indicating that the function can be called from outside the contract. The function takes one parameter `_devaddr`, which represents the new developer address to be set.

Within the function, there is a `require` statement that checks if the sender of the transaction has the admin role using the `accessControls.hasAdminRole` function. If the sender does not have the admin role, the function will revert with the error message "MISOAccessFactory.setMinimumFee: Sender must be admin".

If the sender has the admin role, the function emits an `DevAddressUpdated` event with the old developer address `devaddr` and the new developer address `_devaddr`. This event can be used to track changes in the developer address.

Finally, the `devaddr` is updated with the new developer address `_devaddr`.

Summary:
The `setDev` function allows an admin to update the developer address by checking the sender's admin role, emitting an event with the old and new developer addresses, and updating the developer address if the sender has the necessary permissions.
