This code snippet defines an external function named `getCommitSelector` that is marked as `pure` and overrides a function from an inherited contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- The function returns a `bytes4` value representing the selector of the `commitAndRevert` function.

Code Breakdown:
- The function signature includes the `external` visibility specifier, indicating that the function can be called from outside the contract. It is also marked as `pure`, meaning it does not read from or modify the contract's state.
- The function overrides a function from an inherited contract, which means it provides a specific implementation for the function defined in the parent contract.
- Inside the function, a single statement is executed, which returns the selector of the `commitAndRevert` function using `this.commitAndRevert.selector`. The `selector` property is a built-in Solidity feature that returns the four-byte function selector of a function.
- The function returns this selector value as a `bytes4` type.

Summary:
- The `getCommitSelector` function is an external pure function that overrides a function from an inherited contract. It returns the four-byte selector of the `commitAndRevert` function. This function can be useful for obtaining the function selector dynamically within the contract.
