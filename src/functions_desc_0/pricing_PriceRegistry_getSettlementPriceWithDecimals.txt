This code defines an external view function named `getSettlementPriceWithDecimals` that retrieves the settlement price for a specific oracle, asset, and expiry timestamp. The function accepts three parameters: `_oracle` (address of the oracle), `_asset` (address of the asset), and `_expiryTimestamp` (timestamp of the expiry). Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_oracle`: Address of the oracle that provides the settlement price.
2. `_asset`: Address of the asset for which the settlement price is being retrieved.
3. `_expiryTimestamp`: Timestamp indicating the expiry time for which the settlement price is set.

Return Value:
`settlementPrice`: A struct of type `PriceWithDecimals` that contains the settlement price with decimals.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `_oracle`, `_asset`, and `_expiryTimestamp`. `getSettlementPriceWithDecimals` is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the contract state. The function returns a `PriceWithDecimals` struct variable named `settlementPrice`. 
The function retrieves the settlement price for the given oracle, asset, and expiry timestamp from the `_settlementPrices` mapping. 
It then checks if the retrieved settlement price is not equal to 0 using a `require` statement. If the settlement price is 0, the function reverts with an error message indicating that no settlement price has been set for the provided parameters.

Summary:
The `getSettlementPriceWithDecimals` function allows external callers to retrieve the settlement price for a specific oracle, asset, and expiry timestamp. It fetches the settlement price from the `_settlementPrices` mapping and ensures that a valid price is returned, reverting with an error message if no settlement price has been set for the given parameters.
