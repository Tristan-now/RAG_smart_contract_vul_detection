This code defines an external function named `unpause` that allows a user with the `PAUSER_ROLE` to unpause the contract. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. None

Return Value:
None

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `external` visibility specifier, indicating that the function can be called from outside the contract. Within the function, a `require` statement is used to ensure that the caller of the function has the `PAUSER_ROLE`. If the caller does not have the required role, the function will revert with the error message "StableCoin: must have pauser role to unpause".

If the caller has the `PAUSER_ROLE`, the `_unpause` function is called. This function is presumably defined elsewhere in the contract and is responsible for unpausing the contract, allowing certain functionalities to be resumed.

Summary:
The `unpause` function serves as a permissioned method for unpausing the contract. It enforces access control by requiring the caller to have the `PAUSER_ROLE` before allowing the contract to be unpaused.
