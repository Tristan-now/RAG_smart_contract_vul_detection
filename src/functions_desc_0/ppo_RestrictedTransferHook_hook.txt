This code defines a function named `hook` that overrides two interfaces: `BlocklistTransferHook` and `ITransferHook`. The function accepts three parameters: `_from` (address from which the transfer is initiated), `_to` (address to which the transfer is made), and `_amount` (the amount being transferred).

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_from`: The address from which the transfer is initiated.
2. `_to`: The address to which the transfer is made.
3. `_amount`: The amount being transferred.

Code Breakdown:
The `hook` function first calls the `hook` function of the parent contract using `super.hook(_from, _to, _amount)`. This ensures that any logic implemented in the parent contract's `hook` function is executed before the additional logic in this function.

Next, the function checks if the `_from` address is included in the `sourceAllowlist`. If it is included, the function returns without further execution, allowing the transfer to proceed.

If the `_from` address is not included in the `sourceAllowlist`, the function proceeds to the next step. It checks if the `_to` address is included in the `destinationAllowlist`. If the `_to` address is not included in the `destinationAllowlist`, the function reverts the transaction with an error message stating "Destination not allowed".

Summary:
The `hook` function serves as a transfer hook that enforces restrictions on transfers based on allowlists. It first checks if the source address is allowed to initiate transfers and then verifies if the destination address is allowed to receive transfers. If any of these conditions are not met, the function reverts the transaction.
