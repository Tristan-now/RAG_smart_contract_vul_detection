This code defines an external function named `claimRewardTreasury`, which allows the YetiFinanceTreasury address to claim rewards. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `msg.sender`: The address of the account that is calling the function.

Code Breakdown:
The function `claimRewardTreasury` is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function does not accept any parameters. Inside the function, there is a `require` statement that checks if the `msg.sender` (the address of the account calling the function) is equal to the `YetiFinanceTreasury` address. If the condition is not met, the function will revert and the transaction will fail. This ensures that only the `YetiFinanceTreasury` address can successfully claim rewards using this function.

Summary:
The `claimRewardTreasury` function restricts the ability to claim rewards to only the `YetiFinanceTreasury` address. If any other address tries to call this function, the transaction will be reverted.
