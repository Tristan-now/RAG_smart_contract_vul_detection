This code defines an external function named `distribute`, which allows the operator to distribute a specified amount of a token to multiple stashes associated with different pool IDs. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_token`: The address of the token that will be distributed to the stashes.
2. `_toPids`: An array of pool IDs representing the stashes to which the token will be distributed.
3. `_amounts`: An array of uint256 values representing the amounts of the token to be distributed to each corresponding stash.

Functionality:
The `distribute` function can only be called by the `operator` address. It iterates over the `_toPids` array to distribute the specified amounts of the token to the corresponding stashes associated with each pool ID.

Code Breakdown:
1. The function starts with a `require` statement to ensure that only the `operator` address can call this function.
2. It then enters a `for` loop that iterates over the `_toPids` array. In each iteration:
   a. It calls the `poolInfo` function of the `IDeposit` contract, passing the current pool ID `_toPids[i]` as an argument. This function returns information about the pool, including the address of the stash associated with the pool.
   b. It retrieves the `stashAddress` and `shutdown` status from the returned pool information.
   c. It checks if the pool is not in a shutdown state by requiring `shutdown` to be `false`. If the pool is closed, the distribution cannot proceed to prevent the tokens from getting trapped.
   d. It transfers the specified amount of the token `_amounts[i]` to the `stashAddress` using the `safeTransfer` function of the ERC20 token contract associated with `_token`.

Summary:
The `distribute` function allows the operator to distribute specified amounts of a token to multiple stashes associated with different pool IDs. It ensures that the distribution is only carried out if the pools are not in a shutdown state to prevent potential token loss.
