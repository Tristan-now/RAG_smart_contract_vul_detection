This code defines an external function named `redeemVerify`, which is part of an interface that this contract implements. The function is responsible for verifying the redemption of tokens by a redeemer. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `cToken`: The address of the cToken being redeemed.
2. `redeemer`: The address of the redeemer who is redeeming tokens.
3. `redeemAmount`: The amount of tokens being redeemed.
4. `redeemTokens`: The number of tokens being redeemed.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `cToken`, `redeemer`, `redeemAmount`, and `redeemTokens`. The parameters `cToken` and `redeemer` are currently unused and are simply there for future use or potential requirements.
The function checks a specific condition using an `if` statement. It verifies that either `redeemTokens` is zero or `redeemAmount` is also zero. If this condition is not met, meaning `redeemTokens` is zero while `redeemAmount` is greater than zero, the function reverts with an error message stating "redeemTokens zero". This requirement ensures that either the number of tokens being redeemed is non-zero, or the redeem amount is zero, preventing an invalid redemption scenario where both values are non-zero simultaneously.

Summary:
The `redeemVerify` function in this code snippet enforces a specific condition related to the redemption of tokens. It ensures that either the number of tokens being redeemed is non-zero or the redeem amount is zero, preventing an invalid redemption scenario.
