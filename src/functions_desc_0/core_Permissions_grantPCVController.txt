This code snippet defines an external function named `grantPCVController` that allows a governor to grant the `PCV_CONTROLLER_ROLE` role to a specified address `pcvController`. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `pcvController`: The address of the account to which the `PCV_CONTROLLER_ROLE` role will be granted.

Functionality:
- The function `grantPCVController` is marked as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- The function is part of a contract that implements an interface with an `override` modifier, indicating that it overrides a function from the interface.
- The function is restricted to be called only by the governor of the contract, as indicated by the `onlyGovernor` modifier.
- Within the function, the `grantRole` function is called with two parameters: the `PCV_CONTROLLER_ROLE` role and the `pcvController` address.
- The `grantRole` function is a built-in function that grants a specific role to a specified address. In this case, it grants the `PCV_CONTROLLER_ROLE` to the `pcvController` address.

Summary:
In summary, the `grantPCVController` function allows the governor of the contract to grant the `PCV_CONTROLLER_ROLE` role to a specified address `pcvController`. This role assignment is crucial for controlling and managing the Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) within the contract.
