This code snippet defines an internal function named `recoverAddr` that is responsible for recovering the address from a given hash and signature. The function takes two parameters: `hash`, which is a bytes32 type representing the hash value, and `sig`, which is a bytes array representing the signature. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `hash`: A bytes32 value representing the hash from which the address needs to be recovered.
2. `sig`: A bytes array containing the signature data needed to recover the address.

Return Value:
The function returns an `address` value representing the address recovered from the hash and signature.

Code Breakdown:
The `recoverAddr` function is an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state of the contract.
Within the function body, it calls another internal function named `recoverAddrImpl` with the parameters `hash`, `sig`, and `false`. This function is responsible for the actual address recovery process.
The `recoverAddrImpl` function is not provided in the given code snippet, but it is assumed to handle the ECDSA signature verification process to recover the address from the given hash and signature.
The `recoverAddr` function acts as a wrapper around the `recoverAddrImpl` function, providing a simplified interface for external callers to recover addresses from hashes and signatures.
Overall, the `recoverAddr` function serves as a convenient abstraction for address recovery operations within the smart contract, encapsulating the signature verification logic and returning the resulting address.

In summary, the `recoverAddr` function facilitates the recovery of an address from a given hash and signature by calling an internal implementation function that handles the signature verification process.
