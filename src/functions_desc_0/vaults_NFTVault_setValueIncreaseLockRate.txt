This code defines an external function named `setValueIncreaseLockRate` that allows only the address with the DAO_ROLE to set the value increase lock rate in the contract settings. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_valueIncreaseLockRate`: A `Rate` struct parameter that contains the rate values for the value increase lock rate.

Function Modifier:
- `onlyRole(DAO_ROLE)`: This modifier ensures that only the address with the DAO_ROLE can call this function.

Code Breakdown:
- The function signature includes the `external` visibility specifier, indicating that the function can be called from outside the contract, and the `onlyRole(DAO_ROLE)` modifier, restricting access to addresses with the DAO_ROLE.
- Inside the function, the `_validateRate` function is called to validate the `_valueIncreaseLockRate` parameter, ensuring that the rate values are within acceptable ranges.
- After validation, the `settings.valueIncreaseLockRate` is updated with the provided `_valueIncreaseLockRate` value, updating the value increase lock rate in the contract settings.

Summary:
The `setValueIncreaseLockRate` function allows only authorized addresses with the DAO_ROLE to set the value increase lock rate in the contract settings by providing a `Rate` struct parameter. The function ensures that the rate values are valid and then updates the value increase lock rate in the contract settings.
