This code snippet defines an external view function named `getCurvePool` that retrieves the address of a Curve pool based on the input token addresses `_tokenIn` and `_tokenOut`. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_tokenIn`: The address of the input token for the Curve pool.
2. `_tokenOut`: The address of the output token for the Curve pool.

Return Value:
The function returns the address of the Curve pool that corresponds to the input token addresses `_tokenIn` and `_tokenOut`.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes two parameters `_tokenIn` and `_tokenOut`, representing the input and output tokens for the Curve pool, respectively. The function is defined as `external view`, indicating that it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the contract state.
Within the function body, it simply returns the address stored in the `_curvePools` mapping at the key `_tokenIn][_tokenOut`. This mapping is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract and stores the addresses of Curve pools based on the input and output token pairs.
When the function is called with specific input token addresses `_tokenIn` and `_tokenOut`, it retrieves the corresponding Curve pool address from the mapping and returns it to the caller.

Summary:
The `getCurvePool` function provides a convenient way to retrieve the address of a Curve pool based on the input and output token addresses. By querying the `_curvePools` mapping with the given token addresses, the function returns the specific Curve pool address associated with those tokens.
