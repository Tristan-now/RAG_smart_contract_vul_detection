This code snippet defines an external function named `afterRedeemHook` that overrides a virtual function. The function accepts an array of `uint256` values as input, representing token IDs. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `tokenIds`: An array of `uint256` values that represent the token IDs of tokens being redeemed.

Code Breakdown:
The `afterRedeemHook` function is declared as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. It overrides a virtual function, indicating that it provides a specific implementation for a function defined in an inherited contract.
The function signature includes the parameter `tokenIds`, which is an array of `uint256` values representing the token IDs of tokens being redeemed.
The function body is empty, denoted by `{}`, indicating that no specific logic is implemented within the function.
Summary:
The `afterRedeemHook` function serves as a placeholder for custom logic that needs to be executed after tokens are redeemed. Developers can override this function in derived contracts to implement specific actions or operations that should occur after the redemption process.
