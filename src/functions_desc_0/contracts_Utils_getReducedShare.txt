This code snippet defines a public function named `getReducedShare` that calculates a reduced share value based on the input parameters. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `amount`: A `uint` representing the initial amount for which the reduced share needs to be calculated.
2. `rewardReductionFactor`: A `uint` representing the factor by which the reward needs to be reduced.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint` value representing the reduced share amount.

Code Breakdown:
The `getReducedShare` function is a public function, meaning it can be called externally. It accepts two parameters: `amount` and `rewardReductionFactor`, both of type `uint`. Inside the function, it calls another function named `calcShare` with the following parameters:
- `1`: This is a constant value passed as the first argument to `calcShare`.
- `rewardReductionFactor`: The `rewardReductionFactor` parameter passed to `getReducedShare`.
- `amount`: The initial amount passed to `getReducedShare`.

The `calcShare` function is responsible for calculating the reduced share based on the provided parameters. In this case, the `1` passed as the first argument suggests that the calculation is based on a specific constant value. The `rewardReductionFactor` is used to adjust the reward amount, and the `amount` parameter is the initial amount for which the reduced share is being calculated.

Overall, the `getReducedShare` function simplifies the process of calculating a reduced share amount by calling the `calcShare` function with appropriate parameters. This can be useful in scenarios where a reward needs to be reduced based on a specific factor.
