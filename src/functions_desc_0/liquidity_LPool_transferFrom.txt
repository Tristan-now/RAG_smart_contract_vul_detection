This code snippet defines an external function named `transferFrom` that allows a user to transfer a specified amount of tokens from one address (`src`) to another address (`dst`). Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `src`: The address from which the tokens will be transferred.
2. `dst`: The address to which the tokens will be transferred.
3. `amount`: The amount of tokens to be transferred.

Return Value:
The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the token transfer was successful (`true`) or not (`false`).

Code Breakdown:
The `transferFrom` function is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. It overrides a function from an interface (not shown in the provided code snippet) and is marked as `nonReentrant`, which likely prevents reentrancy attacks by ensuring that the function cannot be called recursively.

Within the function, a call is made to another function named `transferTokens` with the parameters `msg.sender`, `src`, `dst`, and `amount`. This function is responsible for actually transferring the tokens from the source address to the destination address.

Summary:
The `transferFrom` function acts as a wrapper that delegates the token transfer functionality to the `transferTokens` function. It allows users to transfer tokens from one address to another and ensures that the transfer operation is not reentrant.
