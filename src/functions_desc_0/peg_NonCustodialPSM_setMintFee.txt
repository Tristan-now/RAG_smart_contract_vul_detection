This code snippet defines an external function named `setMintFee` that allows for setting a new minting fee in basis points. The function requires the caller to have either the `GOVERNOR` or `PARAMETER_ADMIN` role. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `newMintFeeBasisPoints`: A `uint256` parameter representing the new minting fee to be set in basis points.

Function Modifier:
- `hasAnyOfTwoRoles(TribeRoles.GOVERNOR, TribeRoles.PARAMETER_ADMIN)`: This modifier ensures that the caller of the `setMintFee` function has either the `GOVERNOR` or `PARAMETER_ADMIN` role.

Function Implementation:
- The `setMintFee` function is defined as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- The function overrides a function from an interface or a parent contract, indicating that it implements the required functionality.
- Within the function body, the `_setMintFee` function is called with the `newMintFeeBasisPoints` parameter. This function is presumably defined elsewhere in the contract and is responsible for setting the new minting fee.

Summary:
The `setMintFee` function provides a way to set a new minting fee in basis points. It enforces role-based access control by requiring the caller to have either the `GOVERNOR` or `PARAMETER_ADMIN` role. Upon successful execution, the function delegates the actual setting of the minting fee to the `_setMintFee` function.
