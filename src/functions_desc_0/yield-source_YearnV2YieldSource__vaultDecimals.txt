This code defines an internal view function named `_vaultDecimals` that retrieves the number of decimals used by the vault contract. The function simply calls the `decimals` function of the `vault` contract and returns the result as a `uint256` value.

Explanation:

1. Function Signature:
   - The function `_vaultDecimals` is defined as an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state of the contract.

2. Return Value:
   - The function returns a `uint256` value representing the number of decimals used by the vault contract.

3. Code Breakdown:
   - Within the function body, a single line of code is present which calls the `decimals` function of the `vault` contract.
   - The result of this function call is immediately returned by the `_vaultDecimals` function.

4. Summary:
   - The `_vaultDecimals` function serves as a simple wrapper around the `decimals` function of the `vault` contract, providing a convenient way to retrieve the number of decimals used by the vault contract within the current contract.
