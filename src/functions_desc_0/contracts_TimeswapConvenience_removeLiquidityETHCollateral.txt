This code snippet defines an external function named `removeLiquidityETHCollateral` that implements the `removeLiquidityETHCollateral` function from the `natives` contract. The function takes a single parameter `params` of type `RemoveLiquidityETHCollateral` in calldata format. The function returns two values: `assetOut` of type `uint256` and `collateralOut` of type `uint128`.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `params`: This parameter of type `RemoveLiquidityETHCollateral` contains the necessary information required to remove liquidity in the form of ETH collateral.

Return Values:
1. `assetOut`: This variable of type `uint256` represents the amount of asset tokens received after removing liquidity.
2. `collateralOut`: This variable of type `uint128` represents the amount of collateral (ETH) received after removing liquidity.

Code Breakdown:
- The `removeLiquidityETHCollateral` function is defined as an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- Within the function body, a tuple `(assetOut, collateralOut)` is used to capture the return values from calling the `natives.removeLiquidityETHCollateral` function with the provided `factory`, `weth`, and `params` as arguments.
- The `natives.removeLiquidityETHCollateral` function is responsible for handling the logic of removing liquidity in the form of ETH collateral. It calculates the amount of asset tokens and collateral (ETH) to be received based on the provided parameters.
- The values of `assetOut` and `collateralOut` returned by the `natives.removeLiquidityETHCollateral` function are then assigned to the respective variables in the tuple.
- Finally, the function returns the `assetOut` and `collateralOut` values to the caller.

Summary:
The `removeLiquidityETHCollateral` function serves as a wrapper that delegates the task of removing liquidity in the form of ETH collateral to the `natives` contract. It retrieves the resulting amounts of asset tokens and collateral (ETH) and returns them to the caller.
