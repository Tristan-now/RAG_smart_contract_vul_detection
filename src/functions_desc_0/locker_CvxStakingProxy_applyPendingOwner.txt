This code defines an external function named `applyPendingOwner`, which allows the current owner of the contract to transfer ownership to a pending owner. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `msg.sender`: The address of the account that is calling the function.
2. `owner`: The current owner of the contract.
3. `pendingOwner`: The address of the pending owner who is set to take ownership.

Code Breakdown:
The function starts with two `require` statements to ensure that the caller of the function is the current owner and that there is a valid pending owner address set. If either of these conditions is not met, the function will revert with an error message.
If both requirements are met, the function proceeds to update the `owner` variable with the address stored in `pendingOwner`, effectively transferring ownership to the pending owner.
After transferring ownership, the `pendingOwner` variable is reset to `address(0)` to clear the pending owner address and prevent any further ownership changes until a new pending owner is set.

Summary:
The `applyPendingOwner` function allows the current owner of the contract to transfer ownership to a pending owner by updating the `owner` variable with the pending owner's address and clearing the pending owner variable. This function provides a secure way to manage ownership changes within the contract.
