This code snippet defines a function named `setProposalThreshold` that allows the manager to set a new proposal threshold value. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_proposalThreshold`: This is a `uint256` parameter representing the new proposal threshold value that the manager wants to set.

Function Modifier:
- `onlyManager`: This modifier ensures that only the manager can call this function.

Code Breakdown:
- The function `setProposalThreshold` is a public function that overrides a function in the parent contract.
- The function accepts one parameter `_proposalThreshold`, which is the new proposal threshold value that the manager wants to set.
- The function includes a `require` statement to check that the `_proposalThreshold` is less than 1e18 (1 followed by 18 zeros). This check ensures that the proposal threshold value is within a reasonable range.
- If the `require` condition is met, the function updates the `proposalThreshold` variable with the new `_proposalThreshold` value provided by the manager.

Summary:
In summary, the `setProposalThreshold` function allows the manager to set a new proposal threshold value, with a check to ensure that the value is within a reasonable range. This function can only be called by the manager due to the `onlyManager` modifier.
