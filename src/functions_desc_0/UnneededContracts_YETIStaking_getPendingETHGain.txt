This code snippet defines an external view function named `getPendingETHGain` that overrides a function from an inherited interface. The function takes an address `_user` as a parameter and returns a `uint` value representing the pending ETH gain for that user. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_user`: An address parameter representing the user for whom the pending ETH gain needs to be calculated.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint` value representing the pending ETH gain for the specified user.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `external view` modifiers, indicating that it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the contract state. The function also includes the `override` keyword, indicating that it overrides a function from an inherited interface.

Within the function body, it calls a private function `_getPendingETHGain` with the `_user` address as a parameter. This private function is likely defined elsewhere in the contract and is responsible for calculating the pending ETH gain for a specific user.

The `return` statement then returns the result of the `_getPendingETHGain` function, which is the pending ETH gain for the specified user.

Summary:
The `getPendingETHGain` function is an external view function that provides a read-only view of the pending ETH gain for a specific user. It delegates the actual calculation of the pending ETH gain to a private function `_getPendingETHGain` and returns the result to the caller.
