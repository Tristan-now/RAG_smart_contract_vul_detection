This code snippet consists of two parts: a set of function declarations within an interface and a contract that defines storage variables related to delegation.

1. Interface Functions:
- `mint(uint mintAmount) external virtual returns (uint);`: This function is used to mint a specific amount of tokens and returns the amount minted.
- `redeem(uint redeemTokens) external virtual returns (uint);`: This function is used to redeem a specific number of tokens and returns the amount redeemed.
- `redeemUnderlying(uint redeemAmount) external virtual returns (uint);`: This function is used to redeem a specific amount of underlying tokens and returns the amount redeemed.
- `borrow(uint borrowAmount) external virtual returns (uint);`: This function is used to borrow a specific amount of tokens and returns the amount borrowed.
- `repayBorrow(uint repayAmount) external virtual returns (uint);`: This function is used to repay a specific amount of borrowed tokens and returns the amount repaid.
- `repayBorrowBehalf(address borrower, uint repayAmount) external virtual returns (uint);`: This function is used to repay a specific amount of borrowed tokens on behalf of a borrower and returns the amount repaid.
- `liquidateBorrow(address borrower, uint repayAmount, CTokenInterface cTokenCollateral) external virtual returns (uint);`: This function is used to liquidate a borrower's debt by repaying a specific amount and using a collateral token. It returns the amount liquidated.
- `_addReserves(uint addAmount) external virtual returns (uint);`: This function is an admin function used to add reserves to the contract and returns the amount added.

2. Delegation Storage Contract:
- `CDelegationStorage` contract defines a storage variable `implementation` of type `address`. This variable stores the implementation address for the contract, which is used for delegation purposes.

Overall, the interface declares functions related to token minting, redemption, borrowing, and repayment, along with an admin function for adding reserves. The `CDelegationStorage` contract provides storage for the implementation address used in delegation.
