This code snippet defines an external function named `unbond`, which allows users to unbond a specified amount of tokens. The function calls another internal function `unbondWithHint` with the provided amount and two additional parameters set to the zero address.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_amount`: A `uint256` value representing the amount of tokens to unbond.

Functionality:
The `unbond` function is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. It takes a single parameter `_amount`, which specifies the quantity of tokens to be unbonded.

Code Breakdown:
The `unbond` function is a simple wrapper that calls the internal function `unbondWithHint` with the provided `_amount` and two additional parameters set to the zero address. By doing this, the function delegates the actual unbonding logic to the `unbondWithHint` function, which handles the unbonding process.

Summary:
The `unbond` function provides a user-friendly interface for users to unbond a specific amount of tokens. It forwards the unbonding request to the internal function `unbondWithHint`, which performs the actual unbonding process with the given amount and additional parameters.
