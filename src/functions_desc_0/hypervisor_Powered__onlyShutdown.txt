This code snippet defines a private view function named `_onlyShutdown` that enforces a requirement for the contract to be in a shutdown state. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

1. Function Signature:
   - The function `_onlyShutdown` is marked as private, meaning it can only be accessed within the current contract.
   - It is also marked as view, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract.

2. Code Explanation:
   - Within the function, there is a `require` statement that checks if the contract is in a shutdown state by calling the `isShutdown()` function.
   - If the contract is not in a shutdown state, the `require` statement will revert the transaction with the error message "Powered: is not shutdown".

3. Summary:
   - The `_onlyShutdown` function serves as a modifier to ensure that certain functions or operations can only be executed when the contract is in a shutdown state. It provides a way to restrict access to specific functionalities based on the current state of the contract.
