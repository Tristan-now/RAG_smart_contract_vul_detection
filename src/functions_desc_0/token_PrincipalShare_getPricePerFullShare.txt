This code snippet defines an external function named `getPricePerFullShare` that is part of a contract implementing an interface with a function `returns (uint256)`. The function retrieves the price per full share from a `pool` contract and returns it as a `uint256` value.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- `uint256`: The function returns a `uint256` value representing the price per full share.

Code Breakdown:
- The function signature includes the `external` visibility specifier, indicating that the function can be called from outside the contract, and the `override` keyword, indicating that this function is overriding a function from an inherited interface.
- Inside the function, it simply calls the `pricePerPrincipalShare()` function on the `pool` contract and returns the result. This function likely retrieves the current price per full share from the pool contract.
- The `pricePerPrincipalShare()` function is assumed to be a function defined in the `pool` contract that calculates and returns the price per full share.

Summary:
The `getPricePerFullShare` function is an external function that retrieves the price per full share from a `pool` contract and returns it as a `uint256` value. This function provides a way to query the current price per full share in the context of the contract it belongs to.
