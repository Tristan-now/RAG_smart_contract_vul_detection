This code snippet defines an external function named `payoutClaim` that is part of a contract implementing an interface with an `override` directive. The function is responsible for facilitating the payout of a specified amount to a designated receiver address. Here's a detailed breakdown of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_receiver`: This parameter of type `address` represents the address of the receiver who will be receiving the payout.
2. `_amount`: This parameter of type `uint256` specifies the amount that is intended to be paid out to the receiver.

Functionality:
The `payoutClaim` function is designed to be called externally, meaning it can be invoked from outside the contract. When this function is called, it expects two parameters: the address of the receiver (`_receiver`) and the amount to be paid out (`_amount`).

Since the function is marked with the `override` keyword, it is overriding a function from an inherited interface, meaning that the function signature and behavior must match the interface it is overriding.

Within the function body, the logic for processing the payout is expected to be implemented. This could involve transferring tokens or updating balances within the contract's internal state.

It's important to note that the provided code snippet is incomplete and lacks the actual implementation details of how the payout is executed. The developer would need to add the necessary code to transfer the specified amount to the designated receiver address.

In summary, the `payoutClaim` function serves as a gateway for external entities to trigger a payout operation within the contract, transferring a specified amount to a specified receiver address.
