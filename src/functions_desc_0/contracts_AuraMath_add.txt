This code defines an internal function named `add`, which takes two `uint224` parameters `a` and `b`, and returns their sum as a `uint224` value. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `a`: A `uint224` parameter representing the first operand of the addition operation.
2. `b`: A `uint224` parameter representing the second operand of the addition operation.

Return Value:
`c`: The function returns a `uint224` value representing the sum of `a` and `b`.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `a` and `b`, both of type `uint224`. The function is marked as `internal`, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function is also marked as `pure`, indicating that it does not read from or modify the state of the contract.
Within the function body, the sum of `a` and `b` is calculated and stored in the variable `c`. The addition operation `c = a + b;` adds the values of `a` and `b` and assigns the result to `c`.

Summary:
The `add` function simply adds two `uint224` values `a` and `b` together and returns the result as a `uint224` value. It is an internal pure function that performs a basic arithmetic operation without interacting with the contract's state.
