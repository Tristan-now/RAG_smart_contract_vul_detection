This code snippet defines a public view function named `vcon` that overrides a function from an interface and returns an `IERC20` interface instance.

Explanation:

1. Function Signature:
   - The function `vcon` is declared as a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract's state.
   - The function overrides a function from an interface, indicating that this contract implements an interface that defines a function with the same signature.
   - The function returns an `IERC20` interface instance.

2. Return Value:
   - The function returns an `IERC20` interface instance, which represents an ERC20 token contract.

3. Code Breakdown:
   - The function body simply returns the `_vcon` variable. This variable is likely declared at the contract level and holds an instance of an ERC20 token contract that implements the `IERC20` interface.
   - By returning `_vcon`, the function provides external access to the ERC20 token contract instance stored in `_vcon`.

4. Summary:
   - The `vcon` function is a public view function that returns an `IERC20` interface instance, allowing external entities to access the ERC20 token contract instance stored in the `_vcon` variable.
