This code defines an external function named `availableBalanceOf` that returns the available balance of a specific user. The function takes an address parameter `user` and returns a `uint256` value representing the available balance of that user. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `user`: An address parameter representing the user for whom the available balance needs to be retrieved.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the available balance of the specified user.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `external` visibility specifier, indicating that this function can be called from outside the contract. The function `availableBalanceOf` simply calls an internal function `_availableBalanceOf(user)` to retrieve the available balance of the specified user. The internal function `_availableBalanceOf` is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the contract and is responsible for calculating the available balance based on the user's holdings, transactions, or any other relevant factors. The external function acts as a wrapper that provides a user-friendly interface for querying the available balance without exposing the internal logic of the calculation.

Summary:
The `availableBalanceOf` function is an external view function that allows external callers to retrieve the available balance of a specific user by calling the internal function `_availableBalanceOf`. This separation of concerns helps maintain code modularity and encapsulation by keeping the balance calculation logic internal to the contract.
