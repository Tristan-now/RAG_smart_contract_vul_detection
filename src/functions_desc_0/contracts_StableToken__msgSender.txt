This code defines an internal function named `_msgSender`, which is used to retrieve the address of the message sender. The function overrides the `_msgSender` function from the `Context` and `MetaContext` contracts. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
No parameters are passed to this function.

Return Value:
`sender`: The function returns an `address` value representing the address of the message sender.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `internal` and `view` modifiers, indicating that this function is internal (can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts) and view (does not modify the state of the contract). The function overrides the `_msgSender` function from the `Context` and `MetaContext` contracts. Inside the function, it calls the `_msgSender` function from the `MetaContext` contract using `MetaContext._msgSender()`. This call retrieves the address of the message sender and assigns it to the `sender` variable. Finally, the function returns the `sender` variable, which contains the address of the message sender.

Summary:
The `_msgSender` function is an internal function that retrieves the address of the message sender by calling the `_msgSender` function from the `MetaContext` contract. It then returns the address of the message sender.
