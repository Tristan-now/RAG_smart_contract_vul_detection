This code defines an internal function named `addReserve`, which adds funds to a reserve held by a specific address. The function takes two parameters: `_reserveHolder`, which is the address of the reserve holder, and `_amount`, which is the amount of funds to be added to the reserve. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_reserveHolder`: The address of the reserve holder to whom the funds will be added.
2. `_amount`: The amount of funds to be added to the reserve.

Code Breakdown:
The function `addReserve` is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function takes two parameters: `_reserveHolder` and `_amount`. Inside the function, the funds of the `_reserveHolder` address in the `reserves` mapping are increased by the `_amount` using the `add` function, which is a safe math operation to prevent overflow. This operation effectively adds the `_amount` to the existing funds of the `_reserveHolder`.

After updating the funds in the `reserves` mapping, the function emits an `ReserveFunded` event, indicating that funds have been added to the reserve held by `_reserveHolder`. The event includes the `_reserveHolder` address and the `_amount` that was added to the reserve.

Summary:
The `addReserve` function adds funds to a specific reserve holder's funds stored in the `reserves` mapping. It ensures that the funds are added safely using the `add` function and emits an event to notify external parties about the addition of funds to the reserve.
