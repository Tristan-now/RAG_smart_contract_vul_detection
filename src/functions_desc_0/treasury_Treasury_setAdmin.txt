This code defines a public function named `setAdmin` that allows changing the admin address. The function takes one parameter `admin_` which is the new admin address to be set. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `admin_`: The new admin address that will replace the current admin address.

Functionality:
- The `setAdmin` function is a public function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- The function can only be executed by the current admin of the contract, as indicated by the `onlyAdmin` modifier.
- When the function is called, it updates the `admin` variable with the new admin address provided as the `admin_` parameter.

Summary:
The `setAdmin` function provides a way to change the admin address of the contract. It ensures that only the current admin can update the admin address to maintain control and security over the contract's administration.
