This code defines a private view function named `_getMarketInfo` that retrieves information about a market based on the provided market address. The function returns a struct `MarketBaseInfo` containing various details about the market.

Parameters:
1. `_marketAddress`: The address of the market for which information is to be retrieved.

Return Value:
`marketInfo`: A struct of type `MarketBaseInfo` containing details such as market address, template ID, start time, end time, finalization status, and token information.

Code Breakdown:
The function `_getMarketInfo` begins by declaring a variable `templateId` of type `uint64` to store the template ID of the market obtained by calling the `getMarketTemplateId` function from the `market` contract using the provided `_marketAddress`.

Next, the function declares variables `auctionToken`, `startTime`, `endTime`, and `finalized` to store the base information retrieved from the `IBaseAuction` interface implemented by the `_marketAddress` contract. The values are obtained by calling the `getBaseInformation` function.

The function then calls the `getTokenInfo` function to retrieve detailed information about the `auctionToken` obtained from the market.

Subsequently, the function populates the `marketInfo` struct with the gathered information, including the market address, template ID, start time, end time, finalization status, and token information.

Finally, the function returns the `marketInfo` struct containing all the collected details about the market.

Summary:
The `_getMarketInfo` function fetches and compiles various pieces of information about a market based on the provided market address. It retrieves details such as template ID, auction token, start and end times, finalization status, and token information, and encapsulates them into a `MarketBaseInfo` struct, which is then returned as the output of the function.
