This code defines an external function named `enableList` that allows an admin to enable or disable the use of a point list in the market. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_status`: A boolean parameter that determines whether to enable (`true`) or disable (`false`) the use of the point list in the market.

Functionality:
- The function `enableList` is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- The function requires the caller to have the admin role, which is verified using the `hasAdminRole` modifier.
- The function takes a boolean parameter `_status` that indicates whether to enable or disable the use of the point list in the market.
- If the caller has the admin role, the `marketStatus.usePointList` variable is updated with the value of `_status`. This variable controls the status of the point list in the market.

Summary:
The `enableList` function allows an admin to toggle the use of the point list in the market by setting the `marketStatus.usePointList` variable based on the provided boolean `_status` parameter. This function provides a way to control the behavior of the market with respect to the point list.
