This code defines an external view function named `allowance` that is part of a contract and overrides a function with the same signature from an inherited interface. The function accepts two parameters: `owner` and `spender`, both of type `address`, and returns a `uint256` value representing the allowance granted by the `owner` to the `spender`.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `owner`: The address of the token owner who granted the allowance.
2. `spender`: The address of the entity (spender) to whom the allowance is granted.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the allowance granted by the `owner` to the `spender`.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `owner` and `spender`. The function is marked as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. It is also marked as `view`, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract.
The function accesses the `_allowances` mapping using the `owner` and `spender` addresses as keys to retrieve the allowance value. The allowance value is then returned as the output of the function.

Summary:
The `allowance` function provides a way to query the allowance granted by a token owner to a specific spender. It retrieves this information from the `_allowances` mapping and returns the allowance value as a `uint256`.
