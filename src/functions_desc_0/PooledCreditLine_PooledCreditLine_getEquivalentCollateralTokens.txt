This code defines an external view function named `getEquivalentCollateralTokens` that calculates the equivalent amount of collateral tokens needed for a given borrow token amount in a specific credit line. The function accepts two parameters: `_id`, which is the identifier of the pooled credit line, and `_borrowTokenAmount`, which is the amount of borrow tokens.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_id`: An unsigned integer representing the identifier of the pooled credit line for which the equivalent collateral tokens need to be calculated.
2. `_borrowTokenAmount`: An unsigned integer representing the amount of borrow tokens for which the equivalent collateral tokens need to be determined.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the equivalent amount of collateral tokens required for the specified borrow token amount.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `_id` and `_borrowTokenAmount`. `getEquivalentCollateralTokens` is an external view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and does not modify the contract state.
The function first retrieves the address of the collateral asset associated with the specified credit line `_id` from the `pooledCreditLineConstants` mapping and stores it in the variable `_collateralAsset`. It then checks if the `_collateralAsset` address is not equal to `address(0)` to ensure that a valid collateral asset is set for the credit line. If the collateral asset is not set, the function reverts with the error message 'PCL:CTTL1'.
Next, the function retrieves the address of the borrow asset associated with the specified credit line `_id` and stores it in the variable `_borrowAsset`.
The function then calls the `_equivalentCollateral` internal function with the parameters `_collateralAsset`, `_borrowAsset`, and `_borrowTokenAmount` to calculate the equivalent amount of collateral tokens required for the specified borrow token amount.
Finally, the calculated equivalent collateral tokens amount is returned as the result of the function.

Summary:
The `getEquivalentCollateralTokens` function retrieves the collateral and borrow assets associated with a specific credit line, then calls an internal function `_equivalentCollateral` to calculate the equivalent amount of collateral tokens needed for a given borrow token amount. The function ensures that valid assets are set for the credit line and returns the calculated equivalent collateral tokens amount.
