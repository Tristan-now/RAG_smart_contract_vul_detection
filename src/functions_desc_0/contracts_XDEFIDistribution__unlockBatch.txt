This code defines an internal function named `_unlockBatch`, which is responsible for unlocking multiple tokens for a specific account. The function takes two parameters: `account_`, which is the address of the account to unlock tokens for, and `tokenIds_`, which is an array of token IDs to unlock. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account_`: The address of the account for which tokens are being unlocked.
2. `tokenIds_`: An array of token IDs that need to be unlocked for the account.

Return Value:
`amountUnlocked_`: The function returns a `uint256` value representing the total amount of tokens unlocked for the account.

Code Breakdown:
The function `_unlockBatch` starts by getting the length of the `tokenIds_` array and ensuring that it contains more than one token ID using the `require` statement. This check ensures that the batch unlock operation is being used appropriately.

Inside the function, a variable `amountUnlocked_` of type `uint256` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the total amount of tokens unlocked for the account.

A `for` loop is used to iterate over each token ID in the `tokenIds_` array. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 0 and runs until `i` is less than the length of the `tokenIds_` array. In each iteration, the `_unlock` function is called with the current token ID `tokenIds_[i]` and the account address `account_`. The return value of the `_unlock` function, which represents the amount of tokens unlocked for the account, is added to the `amountUnlocked_` variable.

Summary:
The `_unlockBatch` function processes the unlocking of multiple tokens for a specific account in a batch operation. It iterates over the array of token IDs, unlocking each token using the `_unlock` function, and accumulates the total amount of tokens unlocked. The function then returns the total amount of tokens unlocked for the account.
