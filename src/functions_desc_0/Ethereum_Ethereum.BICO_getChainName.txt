Return Value:
- `string memory`: The function returns a string value representing the name of the blockchain, which is "Ethereum".

Code Breakdown:
- The function signature includes the `public` and `pure` modifiers, indicating that it is a publicly accessible function that does not read from or modify the contract's state.
- The function is marked with the `override` keyword, indicating that it overrides a function from a parent contract or interface.
- The function body simply returns the string value "Ethereum" using the `return` statement.
- The return type `string memory` indicates that the returned string is stored in memory.

Summary:
- The `getChainName` function is a simple function that returns the name of the blockchain as "Ethereum". It is marked as `public` and `pure`, and it overrides a function from an interface.
