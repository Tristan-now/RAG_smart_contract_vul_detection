This code defines a public function named `setTreasuryWallet` that allows the governance address to set the treasury wallet address. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_treasuryWallet`: The new address that will be set as the treasury wallet.
   
Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameter `_treasuryWallet`, which represents the new address for the treasury wallet. The function is marked as `public`, meaning it can be called externally. Within the function, there is a `require` statement that checks if the `msg.sender` (the address that called the function) is equal to the `governance` address. If the condition is not met, the function will revert with the error message "!governance". This check ensures that only the governance address can set the treasury wallet.

If the `require` statement passes, the function updates the `treasuryWallet` variable with the new address `_treasuryWallet`. This effectively changes the treasury wallet address to the one provided as a parameter.

Summary:
The `setTreasuryWallet` function allows the governance address to update the treasury wallet address. It enforces a permission check to ensure that only the governance address can make this change.
