This code defines an internal view function named `functionStaticCall`, which is responsible for making a static call to a target address. The function accepts three parameters: the target address (`target`), the data to be passed to the target address (`data`), and an error message (`errorMessage`). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `target`: The address of the contract to which the static call will be made.
2. `data`: The data to be passed to the target contract.
3. `errorMessage`: An error message to be displayed if the static call fails.

Return Value:
The function returns a `bytes` variable representing the return data from the static call.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `target`, `data`, and `errorMessage`. `functionStaticCall` is an internal view function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts and does not modify the state of the contract. The function first checks if the target address is a contract by calling the `isContract` function and passing the target address as an argument. If the target address is not a contract, the function reverts with an error message.

Next, the function makes a static call to the target address using the `staticcall` function. The `staticcall` function returns a boolean `success` indicating whether the call was successful and the `returndata` containing the return value of the call.

The function then calls the `verifyCallResult` function, passing the `success`, `returndata`, and `errorMessage` as arguments. This function verifies the result of the static call and handles any errors that may have occurred during the call.

Finally, the function returns the `returndata` obtained from the static call.

Summary:
The `functionStaticCall` function performs a static call to a target contract address with the provided data. It verifies the success of the call and returns the return data obtained from the call. If the target address is not a contract, the function reverts with an error message.
