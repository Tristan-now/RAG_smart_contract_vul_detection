This code defines an internal function named `_restake`, which is responsible for restaking a specific NFT (non-fungible token) for a certain period of time. The function takes three parameters: `_id` (the ID of the NFT to be restaked), `_period` (the duration for which the NFT will be restaked), and `_nftOwner` (the address of the owner of the NFT). Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_id`: A uint256 variable representing the ID of the NFT that will be restaked.
2. `_period`: A uint256 variable indicating the duration for which the NFT will be restaked.
3. `_nftOwner`: An address variable representing the owner of the NFT.

Return Value:
`_sher`: The function returns a uint256 value representing the amount of a specific token (sher) earned from the restaking process.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `_id`, `_period`, and `_nftOwner`. `_restake` is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function accepts three parameters: `_id` (the ID of the NFT), `_period` (the restaking period), and `_nftOwner` (the owner of the NFT). The function returns a uint256 variable named `_sher`, which will store the amount of a specific token earned from the restaking process.

Within the function, the restaking logic is implemented, which involves interacting with the NFT contract to restake the specified NFT for the given period. The details of this logic would depend on the specific implementation of the NFT contract and the restaking mechanism.

Summary:
The `_restake` function is responsible for restaking a specific NFT for a certain period of time. It takes the ID of the NFT, the restaking period, and the owner of the NFT as input parameters. The function executes the restaking process and returns the amount of a specific token earned from the restaking activity.
