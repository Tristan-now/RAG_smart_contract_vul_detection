This code snippet defines an external function named `getInternalTotalSupply` that is part of a contract that overrides a function from an inherited interface. The function is responsible for returning the internal total supply of a token.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- `uint256`: The function returns a `uint256` value representing the internal total supply of the token.

Code Breakdown:
- The function signature includes the `external` visibility specifier, indicating that the function can be called from outside the contract, and the `view` modifier, indicating that the function does not modify the contract's state.
- The function overrides a function from an inherited interface, as indicated by the `override` keyword.
- Within the function body, it simply returns the `internalTotalSupply` value stored in the `SherXStorage` contract's `sx` struct. This value represents the internal total supply of the token.

Summary:
- The `getInternalTotalSupply` function provides external visibility to retrieve the internal total supply of a token by accessing the `internalTotalSupply` value stored in the `SherXStorage` contract. This function allows external entities to query the total supply of the token without modifying the contract's state.
