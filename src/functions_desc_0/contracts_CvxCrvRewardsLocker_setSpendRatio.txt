This code defines an external function named `setSpendRatio` that allows the governance to set the spend ratio. The function takes one parameter, `_spendRatio`, which is a `uint256` representing the new spend ratio to be set. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_spendRatio`: A `uint256` value representing the new spend ratio to be set by the governance.

Return Value:
The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the spend ratio was successfully set.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `external` visibility specifier, indicating that the function can be called from outside the contract, and the `onlyGovernance` modifier, ensuring that only authorized governance addresses can call this function. The function first checks if the `_spendRatio` provided is less than or equal to the maximum boost payment allowed by the `ICvxLocker` contract stored in the `CVX_LOCKER` address. If the `_spendRatio` exceeds the maximum boost payment, it reverts with an error message `Error.EXCEEDS_MAX_BOOST`. If the `_spendRatio` is within the allowed range, the `spendRatio` variable is updated with the new value `_spendRatio`. An event `NewSpendRatio` is emitted to log the new spend ratio set by the governance. Finally, the function returns `true` to indicate that the spend ratio was successfully updated.

Summary:
The `setSpendRatio` function allows the governance to set a new spend ratio, ensuring that the provided ratio does not exceed the maximum boost payment allowed. If the provided ratio is valid, it updates the `spendRatio` variable and emits an event to log the change.
