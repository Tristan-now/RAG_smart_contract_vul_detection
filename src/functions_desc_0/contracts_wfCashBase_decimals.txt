This code snippet defines a function named `decimals` that is part of a smart contract. The function is declared as `public`, `pure`, and `override`, indicating that it is a publicly accessible function, does not modify the contract's state, and overrides a function from an inherited contract interface.

Explanation of the `decimals` function:

1. **Function Signature**:
   - `function decimals() public pure override returns (uint8)`

2. **Function Purpose**:
   - The purpose of this function is to return the number of decimal places used for token values. In this case, the function returns a fixed value of `8`, indicating that the token values have 8 decimal places.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns a `uint8` value representing the number of decimal places used for token values, which is `8` in this case.

4. **Function Modifiers**:
   - `public`: This modifier makes the function accessible from outside the contract.
   - `pure`: This modifier ensures that the function does not read from or modify the contract's state.
   - `override`: This indicates that the function is overriding a function from an inherited contract interface.

5. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function simply returns the value `8`, indicating that the token values have 8 decimal places. Since the function is declared as `pure`, it does not interact with the contract's state or external contracts.

In summary, the `decimals` function in this code snippet is a simple getter function that returns a fixed value of `8` to indicate the number of decimal places used for token values in the contract.
