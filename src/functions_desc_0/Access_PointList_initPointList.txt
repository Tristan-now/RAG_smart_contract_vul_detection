This code snippet defines a public function named `initPointList` that overrides a function from an inherited contract. The function takes one parameter, `_admin`, which is an address representing the administrator of the contract.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_admin`: An address representing the administrator of the contract.

Code Breakdown:
The `initPointList` function is a public function that initializes the access controls of the contract by calling the `initAccessControls` function with the `_admin` address as an argument. The `initAccessControls` function is assumed to be defined in the inherited contract and is responsible for setting up the access controls within the contract.

Summary:
The `initPointList` function serves as an entry point for setting up the access controls of the contract by passing the administrator address to the `initAccessControls` function. This function is crucial for initializing the necessary permissions and roles within the contract.
