This code defines a function named `supportsInterface` that overrides the `supportsInterface` function from the `GovernorUpgradeable` and `GovernorTimelockControlUpgradeable` contracts. The function takes a single parameter `interfaceId` of type `bytes4` and returns a boolean value.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `interfaceId`: A parameter of type `bytes4` that represents the interface identifier for which support is being checked.

Return Value:
The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the contract supports the specified interface.

Code Breakdown:
The `supportsInterface` function is declared as a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract's state.
The function overrides the `supportsInterface` function from the `GovernorUpgradeable` and `GovernorTimelockControlUpgradeable` contracts using the `override` keyword.
Within the function body, it calls the `super.supportsInterface(interfaceId)` function to delegate the interface support check to the parent contracts.
The return value of the `super.supportsInterface(interfaceId)` call is then returned by the `supportsInterface` function.

Summary:
The `supportsInterface` function in this code snippet simply delegates the interface support check to the parent contracts `GovernorUpgradeable` and `GovernorTimelockControlUpgradeable` by calling the `super.supportsInterface(interfaceId)` function and returning the result. This function ensures that the contract properly implements the required interface support functionality.
