This code snippet defines an external function named `getReward` that can be called by external entities. The function simply calls another function `getReward` with a parameter `msg.sender`.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Function Signature:
- `getReward()`: This is an external function that can be called from outside the contract.

Code Breakdown:
- The `getReward` function is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
- When this function is called, it internally calls another function `getReward` with the parameter `msg.sender`. This implies that the address of the caller (the external account that triggered the function) is passed as an argument to the internal `getReward` function.
- The purpose of this design is to allow external callers to easily trigger the `getReward` functionality without having to explicitly pass their address as an argument. By using `msg.sender`, the function automatically knows who the caller is and can process the reward accordingly.

In summary, the `getReward` external function simplifies the process for external entities to claim their rewards by automatically passing their address as an argument to the internal `getReward` function.
