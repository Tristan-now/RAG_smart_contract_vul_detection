This code snippet defines an external function named `totalSupply` that is part of a smart contract. The function is marked as `view`, indicating that it does not modify the contract's state. The function overrides a function with the same signature from a parent contract.

Explanation:

- Function Signature:
  - `totalSupply()`: This function does not take any parameters.
  - `external`: This function can be called from outside the contract.
  - `view`: This function does not modify the contract's state.
  - `override`: This function overrides a function with the same signature from a parent contract.
  - `returns (uint256)`: This function returns a `uint256` value representing the total supply of tokens.

- Code Execution:
  - When this function is called, it simply returns the `_totalSupply` variable. This variable likely represents the total supply of tokens in the contract.
  - Since the function is marked as `view`, it does not change the state of the contract and only provides read-only access to the total supply value.

Summary:
The `totalSupply` function in this smart contract returns the total supply of tokens stored in the `_totalSupply` variable. It is an external view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract's state.
