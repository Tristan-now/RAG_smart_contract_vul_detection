This code defines a public view virtual function named `getMinDelay` that returns the minimum delay duration. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- `duration`: The function returns a `uint256` value representing the minimum delay duration.

Code Breakdown:
- The function signature includes the keyword `public`, indicating that this function can be called externally, and `view`, indicating that it does not modify the state of the contract. The keyword `virtual` allows this function to be overridden by functions in derived contracts.
- The function does not accept any parameters.
- Inside the function, it simply returns the value of the `_minDelay` variable. This variable is presumably a state variable defined elsewhere in the contract or inherited from a parent contract.
- The return value represents the minimum delay duration, which is of type `uint256`.

Summary:
- The `getMinDelay` function is a simple getter function that allows external callers to retrieve the minimum delay duration stored in the `_minDelay` variable. It does not perform any complex calculations or modifications to the contract state.
