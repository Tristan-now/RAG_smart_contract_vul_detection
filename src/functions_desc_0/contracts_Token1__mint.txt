This code defines an internal function named `_mint`, which is responsible for minting new tokens and assigning them to a specified account. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account`: The address to which the newly minted tokens will be assigned.
2. `amount`: The amount of tokens to be minted and assigned to the `account`.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `account` and `amount`. `_mint` is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function first checks if the `account` address is not the zero address using the `require` statement. This check ensures that the tokens are minted to a valid recipient.

If the `account` address is valid, the function proceeds to mint new tokens. The total supply of tokens is increased by the `amount` parameter, representing the newly minted tokens. This is done by incrementing the `totalSupply` variable.

Next, the balance of the `account` address is increased by the `amount` parameter, reflecting the addition of newly minted tokens to the account's balance. This is achieved by adding the `amount` to the `_balances` mapping with the `account` key.

Finally, an `Transfer` event is emitted to log the minting of new tokens. The event indicates that `amount` tokens were transferred from the zero address to the `account` address.

Summary:
The `_mint` function is used to mint new tokens and assign them to a specified account. It increases the total token supply, updates the balance of the recipient account, and emits a transfer event to record the minting of new tokens.
