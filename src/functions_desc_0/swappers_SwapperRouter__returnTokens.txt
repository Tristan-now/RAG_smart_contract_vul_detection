This code defines an internal function named `_returnTokens` that is responsible for returning tokens to the caller. The function accepts two parameters: `token_`, which is the address of the token to be returned, and `amount_`, which is the amount of tokens to be returned.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `token_`: The address of the token to be returned. If the address is `address(0)`, it indicates that the token is ETH.
2. `amount_`: The amount of tokens to be returned.

Return Value:
`amountReturned`: The function returns a `uint256` value representing the amount of tokens that have been returned.

Code Breakdown:
The function first checks if the `token_` address is equal to `address(0)`, which signifies that the token to be returned is ETH. If this condition is met, the function transfers the specified `amount_` of ETH to the caller's address using the `payable` function and returns the `amount_`.

If the `token_` address is not equal to `address(0)`, indicating that the token is an ERC20 token, the function uses the `safeTransfer` function from the `IERC20` interface to transfer the specified `amount_` of tokens to the caller's address. The `safeTransfer` function ensures that the transfer is executed safely to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

Finally, the function returns the `amount_` of tokens that have been successfully returned to the caller.

Summary:
The `_returnTokens` function handles the return of tokens to the caller, whether it is ETH or an ERC20 token. It checks the type of token based on the `token_` address and performs the transfer accordingly, ensuring the safe transfer of ERC20 tokens. The function returns the amount of tokens that have been returned to the caller.
