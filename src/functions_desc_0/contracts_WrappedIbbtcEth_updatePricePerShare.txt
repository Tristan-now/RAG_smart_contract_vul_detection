This code defines a public virtual function named `updatePricePerShare`, which updates the `pricePerShare` variable and emits an event with the updated price and the timestamp of the update. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
This function does not accept any parameters.

Return Value:
This function does not return any value explicitly.

Code Breakdown:
The function `updatePricePerShare` is a public virtual function, meaning it can be called externally and can be overridden by derived contracts. Within this function, the `pricePerShare` variable is updated by assigning it the value returned by the `core.pricePerShare()` function. This function call retrieves the current price per share from the `core` contract or external source. The `lastPricePerShareUpdate` variable is then updated with the current timestamp using `now`, which represents the current block timestamp. After updating the variables, an event named `SetPricePerShare` is emitted with the updated `pricePerShare` value and the timestamp of the update.

Summary:
The `updatePricePerShare` function updates the `pricePerShare` variable with the current price per share obtained from an external source (likely the `core` contract). It also updates the `lastPricePerShareUpdate` variable with the current timestamp and emits an event to notify external entities about the updated price per share and the timestamp of the update.
