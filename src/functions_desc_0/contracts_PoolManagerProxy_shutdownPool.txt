This code defines an external function named `shutdownPool`, which is used to shut down a specific pool identified by its pool ID (`_pid`). The function can only be called by the operator of the contract, as indicated by the `onlyOperator` modifier. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_pid`: A `uint256` parameter representing the pool ID of the pool that needs to be shut down.

Return Value:
The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the shutdown operation was successful (`true`) or not (`false`).

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the `shutdownPool` function, which is marked as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function also includes the `onlyOperator` modifier, ensuring that only the operator can call this function. The function takes a single parameter `_pid`, which is the pool ID of the pool to be shut down.

Within the function, it calls the `shutdownPool` function of the `IPools` contract interface, passing the `_pid` as an argument. The `IPools` interface is assumed to be a contract that manages pools, and the `shutdownPool` function is expected to handle the shutdown logic for a specific pool identified by its ID.

The return value of the `shutdownPool` function call is directly returned by the `shutdownPool` function in this contract, indicating the success or failure of the shutdown operation.

Summary:
The `shutdownPool` function in this contract acts as a proxy to the `shutdownPool` function in the `IPools` contract interface, allowing the operator to shut down a specific pool by providing its pool ID as a parameter. The function ensures that only the operator can trigger the shutdown operation.
