This code defines a public view function named `balanceOf` that takes an `address` parameter `account` and returns a `uint256` value. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `account`: An address parameter representing the account for which the balance needs to be retrieved.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the balance of the specified account.

Code Breakdown:
The `balanceOf` function is a public view function, meaning it can be called externally and does not modify the contract state.
Within the function, it calls the `balanceOf` function on the `deposits` contract or storage variable, passing the `account` address as a parameter.
The `balanceOf` function on the `deposits` contract is assumed to return the balance of the specified `account` address.
The function then returns this balance as a `uint256` value to the caller.

Summary:
The `balanceOf` function provides a way to retrieve the balance of a specific account by calling the `balanceOf` function on the `deposits` contract or storage variable and returning the balance as a `uint256` value.
