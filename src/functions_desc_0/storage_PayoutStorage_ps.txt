This code defines an internal pure function named `ps` that returns a storage pointer to a struct named `Base`. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Function Explanation:
The function `ps` is defined as an internal pure function, meaning it does not modify the contract's state and does not read from storage. It returns a storage pointer to a struct named `Base`.

Return Value:
The function returns a storage pointer `psx` to the `Base` struct.

Code Breakdown:
1. The function uses inline assembly to access the storage slot where the `Base` struct is stored.
2. The `PAYOUT_STORAGE_POSITION` constant is a predefined value that represents the storage slot where the `Base` struct is located.
3. The `assembly` block is used to directly access the EVM's assembly language to retrieve the storage slot value.
4. Within the assembly block, the `psx.slot` is assigned the value of the `PAYOUT_STORAGE_POSITION`, effectively pointing to the storage location of the `Base` struct.

Summary:
The `ps` function uses inline assembly to retrieve the storage slot value of the `Base` struct and returns a storage pointer to this struct. This allows other functions within the contract to access and modify the `Base` struct's data stored in the contract's storage.
