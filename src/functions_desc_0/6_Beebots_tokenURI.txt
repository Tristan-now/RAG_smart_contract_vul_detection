This code defines an external function named `tokenURI` that returns the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) for a specific token based on its `_tokenId`. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `_tokenId`: A `uint256` value representing the unique identifier of the token for which the URI is being requested.

Return Value:
The function returns a `string` value representing the URI of the token.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameter `_tokenId`, which is used to identify the specific token for which the URI is being generated. The function is marked as `external`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. The function also includes a modifier `validNFToken(_tokenId)` which ensures that the token with the given `_tokenId` is a valid non-fungible token (NFT) within the contract.

Within the function body, the URI is constructed using `abi.encodePacked`. The URI is a concatenation of two parts:
1. The base URL "https://todo/": This is a placeholder URL that serves as the base for the token URI.
2. The `_tokenId` converted to a string using the `toString` function: The `_tokenId` is converted to a string format to be appended to the base URL.

The `toString` function is assumed to be a custom function that converts a `uint256` value to a string representation.

Summary:
The `tokenURI` function takes a token ID as input, constructs a URI for the token by combining a base URL with the token ID converted to a string, and returns the resulting URI as a string. This URI can be used to access metadata or other information related to the specific token identified by `_tokenId`.
