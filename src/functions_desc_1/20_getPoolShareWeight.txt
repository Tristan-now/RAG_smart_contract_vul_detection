This code defines an external function named `getPoolShareWeight`, which calculates the weight of a user's share in a pool based on the provided token and units. The function accepts two parameters: an address of the token (`token`) and a uint representing the units of the token (`units`). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `token`: An address representing the token for which the pool share weight needs to be calculated.
2. `units`: A uint value representing the number of units of the token.

Return Value:
`weight`: The function returns a `uint` value representing the weight of the user's share in the pool.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `token` and `units`. `getPoolShareWeight` is an external function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract. Within the function, the address of the pool corresponding to the provided token is obtained using the `getPool` function. The weight calculation is performed using the `calcShare` function, which takes three parameters: the user's token units, the total supply of the pool (retrieved using `iBEP20(pool).totalSupply()`), and the base amount of the pool (retrieved using `iPOOL(pool).baseAmount()`). The result of this calculation is stored in the `weight` variable. Finally, the function returns the calculated weight value.

Summary:
The `getPoolShareWeight` function calculates the weight of a user's share in a pool based on the provided token and units. It retrieves the pool address, calculates the share weight using the `calcShare` function, and returns the calculated weight value.
