This code defines a function named `getCurrentPriceInPeg` that calculates the current price of a token in peg units. The function accepts three parameters: `token` (address of the token), `inAmount` (amount of the token), and `forceCurBlock` (a boolean indicating whether to force the use of the current block). Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `token`: The address of the token for which the price needs to be calculated.
2. `inAmount`: The amount of the token for which the price needs to be calculated.
3. `forceCurBlock`: A boolean value that determines whether to force the use of the current block for price calculation.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the current price of the token in peg units.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `token`, `inAmount`, and `forceCurBlock`. Inside the function, a `TokenPrice` struct is retrieved from the `tokenPrices` mapping using the `token` address. The function then checks the value of `forceCurBlock` to determine the flow of execution.
- If `forceCurBlock` is true and the difference between the current block number and the last updated block number for the token is greater than `priceUpdateWindow`, the function updates the cached price by calling `getPriceFromAMM` function.
- If `forceCurBlock` is true but the block number difference is not greater than `priceUpdateWindow`, the function retrieves the current price from the Automated Market Maker (AMM) using `viewCurrentPriceInPeg`.
- If `forceCurBlock` is false and the `tokenPer1k` value in the `TokenPrice` struct is 0, the function calls `getPriceFromAMM` to get the price from AMM.
- If the block number difference is greater than `priceUpdateWindow`, the function updates the price by calling `getPriceFromAMM`.
- Finally, the function calculates the current price of the token in peg units by dividing the input amount by the `tokenPer1k` value and multiplying by 1000 ether.

Summary:
The `getCurrentPriceInPeg` function retrieves the current price of a token in peg units based on the input token address, amount, and a boolean flag to force the use of the current block for price calculation. It handles price updates, caching, and calculation logic to provide an accurate representation of the token's value in peg units.
