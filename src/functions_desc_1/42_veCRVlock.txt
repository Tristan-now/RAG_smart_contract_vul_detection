This code defines an external function named `veCRVlock`, which is used to lock CRV tokens in exchange for veCRV tokens. Here's a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
- None

Return Value:
- None

Code Breakdown:
- The function starts with a `require` statement that checks if the `lockCrv` variable is false, meaning that CRV locking is not currently enabled. If `lockCrv` is true, the function will revert with the error message "!lock".
- The `updateFee` function is called to update any fees associated with the transaction.
- The `_buyCRV` function is called to purchase CRV tokens. This function is assumed to handle the process of buying CRV tokens.
- The `_lockCRV` function is called to lock the purchased CRV tokens in exchange for veCRV tokens. This function is assumed to handle the locking process.
- After locking the CRV tokens and receiving veCRV tokens in return, the `veCRVShare` variable is set to 0, indicating that the user no longer holds any veCRV tokens.

Summary:
The `veCRVlock` function is used to facilitate the process of locking CRV tokens to receive veCRV tokens. It first checks if CRV locking is enabled, updates any associated fees, purchases CRV tokens, locks them to obtain veCRV tokens, and then resets the user's veCRV share to 0.
