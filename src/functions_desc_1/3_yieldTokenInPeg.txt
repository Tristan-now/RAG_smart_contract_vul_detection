This code defines an internal function named `yieldTokenInPeg`, which calculates the value of a token yield in peg units. The function accepts four parameters: the token address (`token`), the amount of the token (`amount`), a mapping of yield quotients (`yieldQuotientsFP`), and a boolean (`forceCurBlock`). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works:

Parameters:
1. `token`: The address of the token for which the yield value needs to be calculated.
2. `amount`: The amount of the token for which the yield value needs to be calculated.
3. `yieldQuotientsFP`: A mapping where the key is the token address and the value is the yield quotient in fixed-point format.
4. `forceCurBlock`: A boolean that indicates whether to force the use of the current block.

Return Value:
The function returns a `uint256` value representing the value of the token yield in peg units.

Code Breakdown:
The function signature includes the parameters `token`, `amount`, `yieldQuotientsFP`, and `forceCurBlock`. `yieldTokenInPeg` is an internal function, meaning it can only be called within the contract or its derived contracts. The function calculates the yield value of a token in peg units based on the borrowing yield obtained from the `Lending` contract. 
- The variable `yieldFP` stores the borrowing yield in fixed-point format for the given token, retrieved using the `viewBorrowingYieldFP` function from the `Lending` contract.
- The variable `amountInToken` calculates the yield value of the token by multiplying the token amount (`amount`) with the borrowing yield (`yieldFP`) and dividing it by the yield quotient for the token stored in the `yieldQuotientsFP` mapping.
- Finally, the function returns the current price of the token yield in peg units by calling the `PriceAware.getCurrentPriceInPeg` function with the parameters `token`, `amountInToken`, and `forceCurBlock`.

Summary:
The `yieldTokenInPeg` function calculates the value of a token yield in peg units by utilizing the borrowing yield information from the `Lending` contract, along with the token amount and yield quotient. The function then returns the current price of the token yield in peg units.
